/**
 * Minimal DOM stubs for Web Worker contexts.
 *
 * Two distinct bundler subsystems require these stubs:
 *
 * 1. **Vite's `__vitePreload` helper** wraps dynamic `import()` calls and
 *    injects `<link rel="modulepreload">` via `document` and dispatches
 *    `vite:preloadError` via `window.dispatchEvent()`.
 * 2. **Vite's HMR client** (`vite/dist/client/client.mjs`) probes
 *    `"document" in globalThis` and unconditionally calls every
 *    `document.X` it needs when the probe succeeds — without per-method
 *    `typeof` guards. Defining `globalThis.document` flips that probe
 *    to `true`, so the stub MUST cover every method the HMR client
 *    touches or the worker dies on import.
 *
 * The HMR-client crash is silent and manifests upstream as a
 * perpetually-hanging preview (the kernel client never gets the
 * `worker-ready` message). Audit Vite's `client.mjs` for `document.X`
 * accesses on every Vite upgrade and extend the stub accordingly. The
 * test file pins the contract.
 *
 * **KCL WASM (`web-time`)** reads high-resolution time from `window.performance`.
 * This file replaces `window` with a minimal stub for Vite; the stub must expose
 * `performance` delegated to `globalThis.performance` (which Node worker threads
 * and browsers already define).
 *
 * Environment detection (`getEnvironment()`) uses `WorkerGlobalScope` to
 * distinguish workers from browsers, so these stubs don't affect detection.
 *
 * This module MUST be the first static import in the worker entry point so that
 * stubs are in place before any bundler-injected preload code executes.

 * pulls in `@taucad/runtime/testing` -> `kernel-testing.utils.ts` -> this module),
 * we must NOT define `window`/`document` on the Node global — `gaxios`'s lazy
 * fetch resolver checks `typeof window !== 'undefined' && !!window` and would
 * pick `window.fetch` (undefined) over `node-fetch`'s default, which then
 * surfaces in google-auth-library as `fetchImpl is not a function`.
 *
 * `WorkerGlobalScope` and `importScripts` are scoped to DOM/WebWorker libs
 * which we don't ambiently include here; access them via `globalThis` so the
 * polyfill stays type-safe under both Node and worker compilation contexts.
