## Architecture

Tau is the AI-native CAD platform for the web (`tau.new`), built as an Nx monorepo with pnpm workspaces.

- **Frontend**: React Router v7, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Fumadocs
- **Backend**: NestJS API with Fastify, PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), Redis, Better Auth
- **CAD Engine**: Multi-kernel runtime (Replicad, JSCAD, Manifold, OpenSCAD, KCL)
- **AI**: LangGraph agent with tool-use (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, Ollama)

## Conventions

- Early returns to reduce nesting
- Composition over inheritance; functional programming patterns preferred
- Const declarations over function declarations
- `cn()`/`clsx` for conditional classNames, not ternary
- Max 3 parameters per function; bundle extras into an options object
- Vitest for tests; jsdom env for UI, node env for API
- Hybrid oxlint + ESLint linting; formatting via oxfmt (`.oxfmtrc.json`), not ESLint
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM; schema in `apps/api/app/database/`; auth tables via Better Auth
- Investigate dependency source via `repos/` (managed by `repos.yaml` and `pnpm repos`), not `node_modules`. Use the `repos` skill to clone, add, or explore repos.

## Learned User Preferences

- Write failing tests first (TDD), then fix the code to make them pass; preserve existing tests when adding new ones
- Make minimal, targeted changes; run typecheck on changed files before considering work done — user will revert overly broad fixes
- State machines own lifecycle and state logic; UI clients send events only and never decide open/close; avoid ref/state for sync guards
- Follow policy docs when applicable: testing-policy, library-api-policy, xstate-policy, lint-policy, react-testing-policy, filesystem-policy
- Pin GitHub/dependency versions to exact commit hashes for reproducibility and immutability
- Use `allowlist` over `whitelist` in naming
- When behavior regressed from something that previously worked, prefer config changes over code changes — find the regression
- Use `pnpm patch` tool for dependency patches; do not manually create patch files
- Use `react-virtuoso` for virtualization, not `@tanstack/react-virtual`; follow patterns in `combobox-responsive.tsx`
- Never blow away the entire IndexedDB database — user work is stored there
- Prefer algorithmic, code-level solutions over bundler config or Vite plugins; optimize for 3rd-party consumer DX
- When asked to explore or investigate, present findings and analysis first; do not jump to code changes until implementation is explicitly requested

## Learned Workspace Facts

- Policy docs live in `docs/policy/` (testing, library-api, vision, lint, xstate, typescript, filesystem, react-testing); research docs in `docs/research/`
- Hybrid oxlint + ESLint linting: oxlint runs first, ESLint handles residual rules; custom Oxlint JS plugins in `libs/oxlint/`
- External repos in `repos/` managed via `repos.yaml` and `pnpm repos`; gitignored and cursorignored; add to `.oxlintrc.json` ignorePatterns
- `packages/kernels` is consumed as source via package.json exports, not built output
- Vite plugins in `@taucad/vite` with `*.vite-plugin.ts` suffix, `vite:` prefix for names, and Vite 8 hook filters for Rolldown
- PR workflow: submit as draft; human reviews before marking ready via `gh pr ready`
- Single FS worker architecture; all filesystem access flows through one serialized worker with ZenFS and IndexedDB backend
- Editor architecture: machine owns openFiles, ref-counting, force-close; dockview subscribes only; use unique panel IDs (not file path)
- Two filesystem watch planes: kernel fast path (dependency-scoped) and UI tree path (directory-scoped); do not merge into one coarse stream
- `repos/opencascade.js` WASM build: platform bindings in `BUILTIN_ADDITIONAL_BIND_CODE` (Python layer); full builds (10-30+ min) use `nohup`
- `fromSafeAsync` (`#lib/xstate.lib.js`) replaces `fromPromise` for all UI XState async actors; uses `<TReturn, TInput>` generics matching `fromPromise<TOutput, TInput>`
- Typechecking uses `tsgo` (Go-based TS compiler); do not add cross-project `references` arrays to `tsconfig.json` (causes TS6305)
- Avoid `using`/`await using` syntax in shipped code; Rolldown does not downlevel it and Safari does not support it. Use try/finally with `[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` instead. ZenFS (`@zenfs/core`) also ships `using` in its dist — verify build output with `rg "await using" apps/ui/build/client/assets/`
