> 🚧 **Tau is currently under heavy development.** APIs and interfaces may change as we add new features and improvements.

## Features

- **Open Source** — MIT licensed
- **Browser-Based** — Run CAD on mobile or desktop, no **installation** required
- **Code-Based CAD** — Precise, version-controlled designs through code
- **AI-Powered** — Natural language interface for design creation and modification
- **Parametric Editor** — Adjustable parameters with real-time preview
- **Multi-Kernel** — Choose the right CAD engine for your project
- **Embeddable** — Components to bring CAD into any web application

## Use Cases

- **3D Printing** — Design and export to STL, 3MF, and slicer-compatible formats
- **Game Development** — Create 3D models for games and simulations
- **Industrial Design** — Create 3D models for industrial design and manufacturing
- **CAD Prototyping** — Parametric code with version control and instant iteration
- **Academic Research** — Kernel APIs for computational geometry and educational tools

## Supported Integrations

Tau's multi-kernel architecture lets you choose the best engine for your needs. We're currently focused on mechanical CAD, with plans to expand into electrical design, firmware development, and simulation.
