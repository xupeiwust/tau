 * Concurrency for parallel prerender requests. React Router defaults to 1

 * through the full SSR pipeline (~50–200 ms wall time per page) but the work
 * is mostly I/O and string assembly, not CPU.
 *
 * 4 matches the React Router docs example
 * (https://reactrouter.com/how-to/pre-rendering#concurrency) and is a safe
 * ceiling on a 22 MB SSR Function bundle: enough parallelism to cut the
 * ~40-page prerender pass to a few seconds, low enough to not blow memory in
 * CI runners. Bump cautiously — N > 8 has produced OOMs in similar setups.

/**
 * Pre-render docs URLs by walking the Fumadocs MDX content tree directly
 * with `fumadocs-core/source` helpers (canonical Fumadocs + React Router wiring,
 * see https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs/manual-installation/react-router).
 *
 * `/llms.mdx/*` is intentionally NOT prerendered: nested URL segments and the
 * parent route would both write under `build/client/llms.mdx/...`, causing
 * `EISDIR` (file vs directory collision). Those routes rely on the
 * `Netlify-CDN-Cache-Control` headers on the SSR loader instead.
 *
 * `getStaticPaths()` is NOT used: most static routes here (`/projects`,
 * `/files`, `/usage`, `/settings_`, `/health/*`, `/action/set-theme`,
 * `/api/*`, `/_index`) are auth-gated, runtime-only, or proxy endpoints that
 * would fail prerender. Each safelisted path below is one that genuinely has
 * no per-request work.
 *
 * Static paths delegate to `./app/lib/static-paths` via `import()` so the Nx
 * config loader (`loadConfigFile`) does not eagerly resolve `#` aliases or an
 * extensionless TS specifier as a filesystem path missing the `.ts` suffix.
