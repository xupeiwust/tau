/**
 * Decorative tracer beam that overlays the host container's border with
 * a slow-spinning conic-gradient comet. The wrapper sits just OUTSIDE
 * the host container — positioned `-inset-0.5` relative to a sibling
 * positioning shell — so the host's static border continues to paint at
 * full strength underneath; the beam is purely additive chrome and
 * never replaces the border.
 *
 * Architecture note: this component MUST be rendered inside a sibling
 * `position: relative` shell that auto-sizes to the host container, and
 * that shell MUST NOT carry a `className` passthrough. Any padding /
 * border-radius forwarded to the shell would offset the host container
 * away from the beam and the visible ring would lose its uniform width
 * (the cause of the previous "fat at the top" bug — `pt-1` on the shell
 * produced a 5px gap on the top vs 1px elsewhere). All host-container
 * styling overrides live on the host container itself.
 *
 * @example <caption>typical wiring</caption>
 * ```tsx
 * <div className='relative size-full'>
 *   <ChatTextareaBorderBeam isActive={isSubmitting} />
 *   <div ref={containerReference} className={cn('border bg-background rounded-2xl size-full', className)}>
 *     {children}
