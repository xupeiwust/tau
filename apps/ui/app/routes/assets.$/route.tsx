/**
 * Catch-all loader for `/assets/*` requests.
 *
 * In production the UI is served by an Express server (`apps/ui/server.ts`)
 * that mounts `@react-router/express` after `coiMiddleware` and the
 * `express.static` asset pipeline. Without an explicit route for `/assets/*`,
 * an asset hash that no longer exists on disk (e.g. a
 * stale browser cache pointing at an old chunk) falls through to the SPA's
 * root splat route (`routes/$/route.tsx`) and is answered with a `200 OK`
 * HTML response. The browser then tries to evaluate that HTML as JavaScript,
 * producing an opaque worker load failure that surfaces as the previous
 * `[FileManager] WORKER ERROR: undefined undefined undefined`.
 *
 * Returning a real `404` here turns those stale-hash requests into legitimate
 * network failures so the FileManager's worker-error diagnostics carry an
 * actionable filename + URL instead of a parse error.
 *
 * Real assets are served by Express static middleware *before* the React
 * Router request handler runs, so this loader only ever fires for genuine
 * cache-mismatch / 404 cases — it does not interfere with the normal asset
 * pipeline.
 *
 * Mounted at `/assets/*` automatically by `@react-router/fs-routes`
 * `flatRoutes()` via the `assets.$` directory naming convention.
