/**
 * Samples points from both gears at their assembly positions.
 *
 * This utility is used for the gear8 → assembly split morph animation.
 * It samples points from each gear and applies the correct position offset
 * so the points land at the final assembly positions.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Both returned point arrays have the SAME length as sourcePointCount.
 * This is required because WebGL vertex attributes must all have the same count.
 * The shader uses aTargetSelector to pick which target (A or B) each particle uses:
 * - Points 0 to (splitRatio * sourcePointCount - 1) use gear12 positions (target A)
 * - Points (splitRatio * sourcePointCount) to end use gear8 positions (target B)
 *
 * @param gear12Geometry - The gear12 GLTF geometry
 * @param gear8Geometry - The gear8 GLTF geometry
 * @param sourcePointCount - Number of source points (must match gear8Points.length from morph source)
 * @param splitRatio - Ratio of points going to gear12 (default: 0.6 based on surface area ratio)
 * @returns Promise resolving to AssemblySampledPoints or undefined if sampling failed
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const assemblyPoints = await sampleAssemblyPoints(
 *   gear12Geometry,
 *   gear8Geometry,
 *   3000,  // must match source point count
 *   0.6,   // 60% to gear12
 * );
