# Worker Lifecycle Policy

Standard patterns for creating, managing, and terminating Web Workers in the Tau application. Orchestration-agnostic — applies whether workers are managed by XState, React hooks, or raw JavaScript.

## Core Principles

1. **Every worker must have an owner** — a single code path responsible for both creation and termination
2. **Termination must be guaranteed** — cleanup must survive errors, aborts, and race conditions
3. **Resources must be explicitly released** — workers, MessagePorts, Blob URLs, event listeners
4. **Mobile-first worker budgets** — design for constrained devices; desktop gets the surplus

## Worker Lifecycle Phases

```
CREATE → INITIALIZE → ACTIVE → (IDLE) → TERMINATE → DISPOSED
```

| Phase | Entry condition | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|
| **CREATE** | Owner allocates `new Worker(url)` | Worker's `message` handler is registered |
| **INITIALIZE** | First message exchange (handshake, WASM init) | Worker reports ready |
| **ACTIVE** | Work items dispatched | No pending work |
| **IDLE** | No work for `idleTimeout` duration | New work arrives or timeout expires |
| **TERMINATE** | Owner calls `worker.terminate()` | Worker thread destroyed |
| **DISPOSED** | All references cleared (ports, listeners, refs) | GC collects |

## Creation Rules

### Rule 1: Lazy creation

Create workers only when first needed, not eagerly on mount.

```typescript
// CORRECT: Lazy creation
async function ensureWorker(): Promise<Worker> {
  if (!workerRef.current) {
    workerRef.current = new Worker(workerUrl, { type: 'module' });
  }
  return workerRef.current;
}

// INCORRECT: Eager creation at module scope
const worker = new Worker(workerUrl, { type: 'module' }); // Created even if never used
```

**Exception**: Workers that are always needed (e.g., file-manager root worker) may be created eagerly during application startup.

### Rule 2: Persistent references

Store worker references in locations that survive re-renders and closures.

| Pattern | When to use |
|---|---|
| `useRef<Worker>` | Component-scoped workers |
| Machine context | XState-managed workers |
| Module-level variable | Singleton workers |

Never store workers in `useState` (triggers re-renders) or local variables (lost on scope exit).

### Rule 3: Blob URL cleanup

When creating workers from inline code via `URL.createObjectURL`, revoke the URL immediately after the Worker constructor returns:

```typescript
const blob = new Blob([workerCode], { type: 'application/javascript' });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const worker = new Worker(url);
URL.revokeObjectURL(url); // Worker has already loaded the script
```

### Rule 4: Worker count budgets

| Device class | Max concurrent workers | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile (≤4 cores) | 2 | `navigator.hardwareConcurrency <= 4` |
| Tablet (4-8 cores) | 4 | `navigator.hardwareConcurrency <= 8` |
| Desktop (8+ cores) | `hardwareConcurrency` | Default |

Kernel workers consume 120+ MB each (WASM heap). On mobile Safari, exceeding ~200 MB total page memory causes silent tab crashes.

## Termination Rules

### Rule 5: Error-isolated cleanup

Cleanup chains must survive individual failures. Never let one failing cleanup prevent subsequent cleanups from running.

```typescript
// CORRECT: Error-isolated cleanup
function destroyWorkers(context: WorkerContext): void {
  context.destroyed = true;

  for (const cleanup of context.cleanups) {
    try {
      cleanup();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('[WorkerCleanup] cleanup failed:', error);
    }
  }
  context.cleanups = [];

  // Always runs, regardless of cleanup errors above
  if (context.worker) {
    context.worker.terminate();
    context.worker = undefined;
  }
}

// INCORRECT: Cleanup chain can be interrupted
function destroyWorkers(context: WorkerContext): void {
  for (const cleanup of context.cleanups) {
    cleanup(); // If this throws, terminate() never runs
  }
  context.worker?.terminate();
}
```

### Rule 6: Cleanup resource checklist

When terminating a worker, clean up in this order:

1. **Set destroyed flag** — prevents async operations from recreating the worker
2. **Unsubscribe event listeners** — remove `onmessage`, `onerror` handlers
3. **Close MessagePorts** — call `port.close()` on all associated ports
4. **Call `worker.terminate()`** — kills the worker thread
5. **Null references** — set worker and related references to `undefined`

```typescript
function dispose(): void {
  destroyed = true;                    // 1. Flag
  worker.onmessage = null;             // 2. Listeners
  worker.onerror = null;
  for (const port of ports) {
    port.close();                      // 3. Ports
  }
  worker.terminate();                  // 4. Terminate
  worker = undefined;                  // 5. Null ref
  ports.clear();
}
```

### Rule 7: Graceful shutdown for stateful workers

For workers with in-flight operations (e.g., mid-render kernel workers), use a message-based shutdown handshake with a forced timeout:

```typescript
async function gracefulShutdown(worker: Worker, timeoutMs = 5000): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      worker.terminate();
      resolve();
    }, timeoutMs);

    const handler = (event: MessageEvent): void => {
      if (event.data.type === 'SHUTDOWN_ACK') {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        worker.removeEventListener('message', handler);
        worker.terminate();
        resolve();
      }
    };

    worker.addEventListener('message', handler);
    worker.postMessage({ type: 'SHUTDOWN' });
  });
}
```

For non-stateful workers or time-critical cleanup (component unmount), immediate `terminate()` is acceptable.

---

## Async Safety Rules

### Rule 8: No fire-and-forget async in cleanup-sensitive paths

When an async operation creates or uses a worker, the operation must be cancellable. Fire-and-forget patterns (`void (async () => { ... })()`) escape lifecycle management.

```typescript
// INCORRECT: Fire-and-forget — not tracked, not cancellable
entry: ({ context }) => {
  void (async () => {
    const worker = await createExpensiveWorker();
    context.worker = worker;
  })();
}

// CORRECT (XState): Invoked promise actor — cancelled on state exit
invoke: {
  src: fromPromise(async ({ signal }) => {
    const worker = await createExpensiveWorker();
    signal.throwIfAborted();
    return worker;
  }),
  onDone: assign({ worker: ({ event }) => event.output }),
}

// CORRECT (React): Cancelled flag in useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  let cancelled = false;
  const controller = new AbortController();

  (async () => {
    const worker = await createExpensiveWorker(controller.signal);
    if (!cancelled) {
      workerRef.current = worker;
    } else {
      worker.terminate();
    }
  })();

  return () => {
    cancelled = true;
    controller.abort();
    workerRef.current?.terminate();
    workerRef.current = null;
  };
}, []);
```

### Rule 9: Guard against post-teardown creation

After setting a destroyed/cancelled flag, always check it before creating or using workers:

```typescript
async function ensureWorker(context: WorkerContext): Promise<Worker> {
  if (context.destroyed) {
    throw new Error('Cannot create worker after destruction');
  }
  // ... await some async operation ...
  if (context.destroyed) {
    throw new Error('Worker context was destroyed during initialization');
  }
  const worker = new Worker(url);
  context.worker = worker;
  return worker;
}
```

Check the flag at every yield point (after every `await`).

## XState Integration Patterns

### Pattern A: Worker as invoked callback actor

Best for workers tied to a specific machine state. Cleanup is automatic on state exit.

```typescript
const workerActor = fromCallback(({ sendBack }) => {
  const worker = new Worker(workerUrl, { type: 'module' });

  worker.onmessage = (event) => {
    sendBack({ type: 'WORKER_RESULT', data: event.data });
  };

  // Cleanup: guaranteed to run when actor is stopped (state exit or machine stop)
  return () => {
    worker.terminate();
  };
});

// Usage in machine:
states: {
  active: {
    invoke: { src: 'workerActor', id: 'worker' },
    // Worker auto-stops when leaving 'active' state
  }
}
```

### Pattern B: Worker in machine context with exit cleanup

Best for workers whose lifecycle spans the entire machine (not tied to a single state).

```typescript
setup({
  actions: {
    destroyWorker({ context }) {
      context.destroyed = true;
      if (context.worker) {
        context.worker.terminate();
        context.worker = undefined;
      }
    }
  }
}).createMachine({
  exit: ['destroyWorker'],
  // ...
});
```

**Critical**: `exit` actions on the root machine config run when the machine receives `XSTATE_STOP`. This is the last-resort cleanup.

### Pattern C: Async worker initialization as invoked promise

Best for workers that require async setup (WASM compilation, filesystem connection).

```typescript
const initWorkerActor = fromPromise<Worker>(async ({ signal }) => {
  const worker = new Worker(workerUrl, { type: 'module' });
  await waitForWorkerReady(worker, signal);
  signal.throwIfAborted();
  return worker;
});

// In machine:
states: {
  initializing: {
    invoke: {
      src: 'initWorkerActor',
      onDone: {
        target: 'ready',
        actions: assign({ worker: ({ event }) => event.output }),
      },
      onError: {
        target: 'error',
        // Worker creation failed; no cleanup needed (worker.terminate() on error)
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**Key property**: `fromPromise` receives an `AbortController.signal`. When the state exits (e.g., machine stops during initialization), the signal is aborted and the promise is rejected.

### XState cleanup guarantees

| Mechanism | Cleanup guarantee | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `fromCallback` return function | Called on actor stop (state exit or machine stop) | Worker lifecycle tied to a state |
| `fromPromise` abort signal | Aborted on actor stop | Async initialization |
| Machine `exit` action | Runs on `XSTATE_STOP` | Machine-wide cleanup |
| `stopChild(ref)` | Sends `XSTATE_STOP` to the child | Dynamic child actor cleanup |

**Known limitation**: The XState v5 source contains a TODO noting that if exit actions or `stopChildren` throw, child actors may be orphaned. Always use error-isolated cleanup (Rule 5).

---

## React Integration Patterns

### Pattern: useEffect with cleanup

```typescript
function useKernelWorker(url: string): Worker | undefined {
  const workerRef = useRef<Worker | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const worker = new Worker(url, { type: 'module' });
    workerRef.current = worker;

    return () => {
      worker.terminate();
      workerRef.current = null;
    };
  }, [url]);

  return workerRef.current ?? undefined;
}
```

### Anti-patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `useState(new Worker(...))` | Re-created on re-renders | Use `useRef` |
| Module-scope `new Worker(...)` | Created before component mounts | Lazy init in `useEffect` |
| Missing cleanup return | Worker leaks on unmount | Always `return () => worker.terminate()` |
| `void (async () => { ... })()` in useEffect | Not cancellable | Use AbortController + cancelled flag |
| Relying on `useActorRef` input changes | `useActorRef` does not recreate actors on input change | Use `key` prop or explicit events |

---

## MessagePort and Transfer Rules

### Rule 10: Always use transfer lists for binary data

```typescript
// CORRECT: Zero-copy transfer (buffer detached after send)
const buffer = new Uint8Array(largeData).buffer;
worker.postMessage({ type: 'DATA', buffer }, [buffer]);

// INCORRECT: Structured clone (copies the entire buffer)
worker.postMessage({ type: 'DATA', buffer });
```

Transferable types: `ArrayBuffer`, `MessagePort`, `ReadableStream`, `WritableStream`, `TransformStream`, `ImageBitmap`, `OffscreenCanvas`.

### Rule 11: Close ports explicitly

```typescript
const channel = new MessageChannel();
// ... use channel.port1, channel.port2 ...

// On cleanup:
channel.port1.close();
channel.port2.close();
```

Unclosed ports hold references to their message handlers, preventing GC of associated closures.

### Rule 12: Return disposable handles from bridge factories

Bridge creation functions must return a `{ port, dispose }` handle so callers can clean up both ends of the channel:

```typescript
type BridgeHandle = {
  port: MessagePort;
  dispose(): void;
};

function createBridge(worker: Worker): BridgeHandle {
  const channel = new MessageChannel();
  worker.postMessage({ type: 'bridge', port: channel.port1 }, [channel.port1]);
  return {
    port: channel.port2,
    dispose() {
      channel.port2.close();
    },
  };
}
```

## Diagnostics

### Development-time worker audit

Add a worker registry that logs creation and termination events in development:

```typescript
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  const activeWorkers = new Map<string, { created: number; url: string }>();

  globalThis.__workerRegistry = {
    register(id: string, url: string) {
      activeWorkers.set(id, { created: Date.now(), url });
      console.debug(`[Worker] created: ${id} (${url}), total: ${activeWorkers.size}`);
    },
    unregister(id: string) {
      activeWorkers.delete(id);
      console.debug(`[Worker] terminated: ${id}, total: ${activeWorkers.size}`);
    },
    dump() {
      console.table([...activeWorkers.entries()].map(([id, info]) => ({
        id,
        url: info.url,
        aliveFor: `${((Date.now() - info.created) / 1000).toFixed(1)}s`,
      })));
    },
  };
}
```

### Production monitoring

Use `performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()` (requires cross-origin isolation) to track memory consumption per-worker. This API distinguishes between window, worker, and shared memory:

```typescript
if (crossOriginIsolated && performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory) {
  const result = await performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory();
  const workerBytes = result.breakdown
    .filter(entry => entry.types.includes('Worker'))
    .reduce((sum, entry) => sum + entry.bytes, 0);
  console.log(`Worker memory: ${(workerBytes / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(1)} MB`);
}
```
