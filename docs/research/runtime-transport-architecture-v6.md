# Runtime Transport Architecture (v6 blueprint)

Canonical primitive set for the Tau runtime: how transports, channels, kernels, filesystems, bundlers, transcoders, and middleware compose into a runtime client/host pair that runs identically across in-process, browser-worker, Node worker, and Electron utility-process topologies.

## Executive Summary

This document is the single, prescriptive blueprint for the next planning cycle. It supersedes both [`electron-rpc-transport-architecture.md`](./electron-rpc-transport-architecture.md) and [`transport-capability-ownership.md`](./transport-capability-ownership.md). The substantive change against those documents is one collapse and four strict rules.

The collapse: the prior architecture had three sibling planes — `Port.capabilities` (wire facts), `BackplaneDeclaration` (domain bindings) and `RuntimeRunner` (where the kernel runs). All three are folded into one primitive, **`defineRuntimeTransport`**. A transport now owns the wire, the channel, the kernel host, the memory strategies (SAB / transferables / copy), the cooperative-abort path, the filesystem bridging, and the `initialize` envelope policy as one composable unit.

The four strict rules:

1. **Each transport maximises its own performance for its wire, only degrading when the consumer explicitly opts out.** Capabilities are no longer negotiated through public API surface — they are an implementation detail of the transport. The consumer picks a transport that fits their environment and the transport silently chooses the fastest path its wire allows. This eliminates the `Port.capabilities` leak that violated [`library-api-policy.md`](../policy/library-api-policy.md) §22 Antipattern 5 and reduces the consumer-facing surface to one decision: "which transport?"

2. **Every plugin layer carries phantom generics for end-to-end type inference.** `RuntimeTransportPlugin<Protocol, BindingsExtra, Id, ClientOptions, HostOptions>` mirrors the existing `KernelPlugin<FormatMap, RenderOptions, Id>` and `TranscoderPlugin<EdgeMap, From, Id>` pattern. `HostInitializeBindings<TExtra>` is generic over the per-transport bindings extension so future transports can add their own bindings without touching the runtime core. Consumer call sites stay zero-annotation: `client.transport.id` narrows to `'web-worker'` literally; `webWorkerTransport({ url, fileSystem })` rejects unknown options at compile time.

3. **The wire protocol is authored as Zod schemas, not hand-written TypeScript.** `runtime-protocol.schemas.ts` is the single source of truth — types derive via `z.input` / `z.output` and the channel server validates received frames at the wire boundary. Mirrors the existing kernel pattern where `optionsSchema` / `renderSchema` / `exportSchemas` drive both compile-time inference and runtime validation. Catches mismatched runtime versions, malformed payloads, and renderer-side type drift loudly at the boundary instead of silently corrupting later.

4. **Kernel and plugin APIs are unchanged.** `createKernelPlugin(...)` produces the plugin entry registered in `createRuntimeClient`; `defineKernel(...)` produces the kernel module loaded inside the worker via the plugin's `moduleUrl`. **There is no `worker` field on `KernelPlugin`** — workers are spawned by the transport, not by the kernel plugin. The v6 transport API extends this two-layer pattern: `defineRuntimeTransport(...)` is the only `defineX` that doubles as a plugin factory because a transport's `client` and `host` factories live in the same source file.

The runtime core (`RuntimeClient`, `RuntimeHost`, `RuntimeWorkerClient`, `WorkerDispatcher`) becomes thin. It composes plugins (kernels, bundlers, transcoders, middleware) and delegates every wire concern to the transport. `@taucad/rpc` stays as a separate package because `Channel<P>` is a non-trivial protocol (correlation, cancel, transferables sidecar, lifecycle, hello/bye, optional schema validation) used by transport authors and by adjacent products like the FS bridge — it is the right reuse boundary, not a wrapper to be inlined.

Topology choices are unchanged from the v5 work and remain the recommended targets:

- **In-process**: single isolate, kernel runs on the main thread.
- **Browser**: main thread ↔ Web Worker, kernel in the worker.
- **Node**: main isolate ↔ `worker_threads`, kernel in the worker.
- **Electron (Topology C)**: renderer ↔ main-mediated `MessageChannelMain` ↔ `utilityProcess` kernel host. Renderer never talks to main for runtime data; the main process is the bootstrap relay only.

The v5 Electron PoC findings (renderer↔main `MessagePort`s drop SAB and silently fail when carrying mixed transferables; `utilityProcess` is the idiomatic Electron analogue of VS Code's Extension Host) are retained verbatim because they are environmental facts, not architectural choices.

## Problem Statement

The v5 architecture exposed `PortCapabilities` (a wire-fact bag containing `sab`, `transfer`, `pool`, `signalSlot`) on a public type and required the runtime to read those bits to assemble the `initialize` envelope and to pick the geometry-delivery tier. Three problems followed:

1. **Cross-layer leak.** `library-api-policy.md` §22 Antipattern 5 says wire primitives must not appear in cross-layer public option types. `Port.capabilities` _was_ a wire-fact bag exposed on the public `Port<T>` type and read by `runtime-worker-dispatcher.ts` to pick `pool/transfer` tiers — a textbook violation.
2. **Doc/code drift.** `transport-capability-ownership.md` claimed tiering ran inside `@taucad/rpc.Channel`. It does not — the actual tiering lives in `packages/runtime/src/framework/runtime-worker-dispatcher.ts:148` (`readDeliveryCapabilities(port)`). The runtime, not the channel, was reading wire facts.
3. **Two abstractions doing one job.** `RuntimeRunner` ("where does the kernel run") and `Port` ("how is the wire shaped") were sibling concerns in the public API even though every realistic deployment couples them (a Web Worker wire implies a Web Worker kernel host; a `utilityProcess` wire implies a `utilityProcess` kernel host). The consumer was forced to compose two things that always vary together.

The v6 blueprint resolves all three by collapsing both `RuntimeRunner` and `PortCapabilities` into the new `RuntimeTransport` primitive. The transport owns the wire, the kernel host, the memory strategies, and the initialize policy as one unit. The runtime core never reads wire facts; it asks the transport for typed handles and lets the transport pick the fastest path its wire supports.

## Methodology

This blueprint was derived from:

- A line-by-line read of `packages/runtime/src/framework/runtime-worker-{client,dispatcher}.ts`, `packages/runtime/src/framework/runtime-message-adapter.ts`, `packages/runtime/src/runner/*.ts`, `packages/rpc/src/{channel,port,wire,multiplex}.ts`, and the v5 Electron PoC files under `examples/electron-tau/src/main/`.
- Cross-referencing the prior research docs listed in `related:` plus `docs/research/runtime-channel-blueprint-v5.md` for the channel/wire ground truth and `docs/research/runtime-async-event-contract.md` for the async-materialisation rules that bound any new primitive.
- Adversarial review of the previously proposed simplified `defineTransport` model against actual runtime code paths to detect drift between proposal and implementation.
- The four user-confirmed open-question answers: ship a consumer-owned Electron kernel-host script, keep `fromX` factories separate per FS source, use the minimum protocol primitive set, and defer multiplexing.

Where this document refers to existing code by file path it is current as of the working tree at the date in `updated`. Where it refers to **proposed** files (new shape) it uses the explicit prefix "**(NEW)**".

## Eigenquestions Resolved

The eigenquestion of v5 was: _"who owns capability negotiation between the wire, the channel, and the runtime?"_ The v6 answer rejects the framing — there is no negotiation to own because there is nothing to negotiate.

There is no negotiation surface; the consumer picks a transport and the transport unconditionally uses the fastest path its wire supports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| E2  | Should the runtime read `Port.capabilities`?                                 | Yes (current behaviour, but called out as policy violation)              | No. `PortCapabilities` is removed from the public `Port<T>` shape entirely. The runtime never reads wire facts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| E3  | Should `RuntimeRunner` and the wire be separate primitives?                  | Yes (`runner` + `connect({ port })` as sibling args)                     | No. Both fold into `RuntimeTransport`. The transport spawns the kernel host, opens the wire, and bridges them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| E4  | Should the consumer ever pass a raw `MessagePort` to `createRuntimeClient`?  | Yes (`fromPort(port)`, `connect({ port })`)                              | No. Wire primitives never appear on the public consumer-facing surface. They appear only inside transport plugin implementations and inside `@taucad/rpc` adapters used by transport authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| E5  | Where do `BackplaneDeclaration` / `BackplaneRequest` live?                   | New plane in `runner/backplanes.ts`                                      | Deleted. Their job is absorbed by the transport's `describe()` (diagnostic only) and by the consumer-facing transport options (e.g. `geometry: { poolBytes }`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| E6  | Should `@taucad/rpc` remain a separate package?                              | Yes                                                                      | Yes — confirmed. `Channel<P>` is a substantial protocol used by transport authors and the FS bridge; folding it into `@taucad/runtime` would not reduce surface, only couple unrelated reuse points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| E7  | Should the channel ship a built-in multiplexer?                              | Yes (`packages/rpc/src/multiplex.ts`)                                    | No (deferred). Each concern gets a dedicated channel. Revisit when a real second-channel-per-wire requirement appears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| E8  | Should the runtime ship the Electron transport?                              | Yes                                                                      | No (yet). The Electron PoC ships its own kernel-host script and its own `electronUtilityTransport()` built atop `defineRuntimeTransport`. It moves into the runtime once stable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| E9  | Should each FS source share a single `from(...)` factory?                    | One `from(...)` discriminator                                            | Separate `fromX` factories per source — `fromMemoryFs`, `fromNodeFs`, `fromBrowserFs`, `fromChannelFs`.

| E11 | Should `initialize` carry a structured `memoryHandle`?                       | Yes — runtime assembles it from wire facts                               | Yes — but the **transport** assembles it. The runtime calls `transport.initialize({ middleware, transcoders, ... })`; the transport adds whatever shared memory and ports its wire allows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| E12 | Should `RuntimeTransport` carry phantom generics like `KernelPlugin` does?   | (not addressed)                                                          | Yes — the transport plugin carries `<Protocol, BindingsExtra, Id, ClientOptions, HostOptions>` phantom carriers using the same `unique symbol` pattern as `KernelPlugin`/`TranscoderPlugin`. `HostInitializeBindings<TExtra>` is generic over the transport's per-instance binding shape so each transport contributes its own bindings without coupling the dispatcher to one fixed shape. The runtime client's `RuntimeClient<Kernels, Transcoders, Transport>` carries the transport's phantom so descriptor-typed values flow end-to-end. |
| E13 | Should the wire protocol be authored as Zod schemas (kernel pattern parity)? | (not addressed; protocol typed via TypeScript only)                      | Yes — every call/notify in `RuntimeProtocol` is authored as a Zod schema in `runtime-protocol.schemas.ts`. Types derive via `z.input` / `z.output`; the channel server validates received frames at the wire boundary. Same single-source-of-truth pattern kernels already use for `optionsSchema` / `renderSchema` / `exportSchemas`.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Findings Carried Forward

These findings from prior research are factual / environmental and remain in force.

### Finding 1 — Electron renderer↔main is the weakest wire

`MessageChannelMain` ports that cross the renderer↔main boundary cannot carry `SharedArrayBuffer` and silently drop messages whose payload mixes `MessagePort` transferables with other complex objects. (`event.data === null` was the v5 bug.) The fix is structural, not protocol-level: do not put the kernel runner on this wire.

### Finding 2 — `utilityProcess` is the idiomatic Electron compute host

`utilityProcess.fork()` produces a Node-capable child with a stable `parentPort` and supports direct `MessageChannelMain` port handoff from the renderer (relayed by main). This mirrors VS Code's Extension Host and is the only Electron primitive that simultaneously gives Node addons, off-thread compute, and SAB-capable ports between the renderer and the host.

### Finding 3 — Topology C is the recommended Electron shape

```
renderer  ─── direct MessagePortMain ─── utilityProcess (kernel host)
             ↑
       main process (bootstrap relay only — never on the data path)
```

The main process spawns the utility process, creates a `MessageChannelMain`, and posts one half to each peer. Subsequent runtime traffic flows directly renderer↔utility — main is never woken up for runtime calls.

### Finding 4 — Layered FS authority (VS Code precedent)

Each Electron process holds its own `RuntimeFileSystem` instance pointed at the project root. The renderer and the utility process do **not** share an FS handle over the wire; they each call their own local FS. Cache invalidation flows over a side channel (a thin RPC bridge) when needed. This avoids the v5 trap where the kernel had to read CAD bytes through an `IpcMainInvoke → MessageChannelMain → kernel` round-trip.

### Finding 5 — In-renderer worker topology stays unchanged

Browser topology continues to be `main ↔ Web Worker`, and the kernel runs in the worker. There is no benefit to a "main-worker plus runner-worker" hierarchy because browser main threads do not host CPU-bound work the way Electron's main process does (Tau's main thread is React + dockview, not native bindings).

### Finding 6 — `Channel<P>` is non-trivial and worth keeping

The protocol implements: hello/bye lifecycle, request correlation, cancel, error mapping, transferables sidecar (`WithTransferables`), flow control, stream subscriptions (`listen`), and graceful close. Replacing it with bare `postMessage`/`onMessage` would push every transport author to reimplement these. Conclusion: keep `@taucad/rpc.Channel` as the single typed-RPC primitive transport authors use.

### Finding 7 — `library-api-policy.md` §22 Antipattern 5 binds this design

Wire primitives (`MessagePort`, `SharedArrayBuffer`, `Worker`) must not appear on cross-layer public option objects. The v6 design enforces this by making `RuntimeTransport` the only thing the consumer composes; wire primitives appear only inside transport implementations and the `@taucad/rpc` boundary used by transport authors.

### Finding 8 — Async event materialisation rules apply

Per `runtime-async-event-contract.md`, transports must preserve sync-vs-async boundaries: an `onMessage` handler that returns a promise must not race against the next message dispatch. The transport facade enforces this by serialising message dispatch through the same `Channel<P>` primitive that already passes its async tests.

### Finding 9 — Generic inference must propagate through every plugin layer

The kernel/transcoder plugin layer already implements zero-annotation type inference end-to-end via the patterns documented in [`generic-inference-pipeline.md`](./generic-inference-pipeline.md): unique-symbol phantom carriers (`__exportSchemas`, `__renderSchema`, `__kernelId`, `__transcodeEdges`, `__transcodeFrom`, `__transcoderId`), per-plugin tuple aggregators (`CollectFormatMap`, `CollectKernelIds`, `CollectRenderOptions`, `CollectTranscodeMap`, `KnownTranscoderIds`), and config-as-source inference driven by Zod schemas (`optionsSchema`, `exportSchemas`, `renderSchema`). Three constraints follow for the transport layer:

1. **`RuntimeTransport` must carry phantom generics symmetric to `KernelPlugin`.** Its phantoms are `Protocol` (the wire protocol map), `BindingsExtra` (per-transport host bindings), `Id` (the literal transport id), `ClientOptions` (inferred from `clientOptionsSchema` if present), and `HostOptions` (inferred from `hostOptionsSchema` if present). Without these carriers, `RuntimeClient<Kernels, Transcoders, Transport>` cannot retain transport-specific type information through composition.

2. **`HostInitializeBindings` must be generic.** Hardcoding the bindings shape (`{ geometryPool?, filePool?, abortSignal, fileSystem }`) couples every transport to one fixed contract — a future transport that wants to add bindings (a remote auth context, a GPU device handle, a streaming telemetry sink) cannot extend the type without modifying the runtime core. The canonical core (`fileSystem`, `abort`, `geometryDelivery`, `fileDelivery`) plus a per-transport `BindingsExtra` extension slot is the same pattern `KernelDefinition` uses for `Context`/`NativeHandle`/`SerializedHandle`.

3. **Same partial-inference workarounds apply.** TypeScript's partial inference limitation (any explicit generic parameter forces all others to defaults) means the transport's generics must be fully inferable from the definition object. The `defineRuntimeTransport` factory takes Zod schemas for client/host options so types derive via `z.input`, exactly as `createKernelPlugin` does.

The full chain — `defineRuntimeTransport(definition) → RuntimeTransportPlugin<Protocol, BindingsExtra, Id, ClientOptions, HostOptions> → createRuntimeClient({ transport }) → RuntimeClient<Kernels, Transcoders, Transport>` — preserves type information at every seam.

The hard rule between layers: **each layer only depends on the layer immediately below it.** Layer 5 (the runtime surface) never imports from Layer 1 (raw wire primitives). Layer 4 transports import from Layer 2 (`@taucad/rpc`), never expose Layer 1 types on their public option shapes.

**Convention recap.** `defineX` produces a definition consumed by infrastructure (the dispatcher loads `defineKernel` definitions inside the worker; the dispatcher loads `defineTranscoder` definitions on demand). `createXPlugin` produces a registerable plugin object consumed by composition (the consumer registers plugins with `createRuntimeClient`). `defineRuntimeTransport` is the only `defineX` that doubles as a plugin factory, because a transport has no separate "module" layer — its `client` and `host` factories run on opposite sides of the wire from one source file.

### Surface counts (consumer vs author)

A first-time consumer of `@taucad/runtime` writes one factory call:

```typescript
const client = createRuntimeClient({
  kernels: [replicad()],
  transport: webWorkerTransport({ url: workerUrl, fileSystem: fromMemoryFs(initialFiles) }),
});
await client.connect();
```

That is the entire consumer surface. Five identifiers, one decision (`webWorkerTransport` vs `inProcessTransport` vs `electronUtilityTransport`).

A transport plugin author imports more — `defineRuntimeTransport`, `Channel`, `wrapMessagePort`, `RuntimeProtocol` — but they are not "consumers" in the policy sense; they are extending the framework.

## The Primitives

Every primitive below uses one of three factory shapes consistently:

- `defineX(...)` — author-facing factory that produces a plugin definition (e.g. `defineKernel`, `defineRuntimeTransport`). Definitions are reused across many client instances.
- `fromX(...)` — instance-producing factory that adapts an external resource into a runtime-owned handle (e.g. `fromNodeFs`, `fromMemoryFs`). One call ↔ one handle.
- `createX(...)` — top-level constructor that composes plugins and handles into a working instance (e.g. `createRuntimeClient`, `createRuntimeHost`, `createChannelClient`).

### `createRuntimeClient` — top-level client

```typescript
import { createRuntimeClient } from '@taucad/runtime';
import { replicad, openscad } from '@taucad/runtime/kernels';
import { esbuild } from '@taucad/runtime/bundler';
import { converterTranscoder } from '@taucad/runtime/transcoders';
import { geometryCacheMiddleware } from '@taucad/runtime/middleware';
import { webWorkerTransport } from '@taucad/runtime/transport';
import { fromMemoryFs } from '@taucad/runtime/filesystem';

const fs = fromMemoryFs({ '/main.ts': sourceCode });

const client = createRuntimeClient({
  kernels: [replicad(), openscad()],
  bundlers: [esbuild()],
  transcoders: [converterTranscoder()],
  middleware: [geometryCacheMiddleware()],
  transport: webWorkerTransport({
    url: new URL('./kernel-worker.ts', import.meta.url),
    fileSystem: fs,
  }),
});

await client.connect();
const geometry = await client.openFile({ file: { path: '/main.ts' }, parameters: {} });
```

The `transport` field is a single value. The runtime never sees a `port`, `runner`, or `capabilities` argument.

### `createRuntimeHost` — kernel-host side

Called inside whatever script the transport's `host` factory is intended to run. For the in-process transport this is unused (the host runs inside the same isolate); for `webWorkerTransport` it lives in the worker entry; for `electronUtilityTransport` it lives in the consumer-owned utility-process script.

```typescript
import { createRuntimeHost } from '@taucad/runtime/host';
import { replicad } from '@taucad/runtime/kernels';
import { electronUtilityTransport } from './electron-utility-transport.js';
import { fromNodeFs } from '@taucad/runtime/filesystem/node';

createRuntimeHost({
  kernels: [replicad()],
  fileSystem: fromNodeFs(process.env.TAU_PROJECT_ROOT!),
  transport: electronUtilityHost(),
});
```

The host script is symmetric with the client: same plugin shape, different transport entry.

### `defineRuntimeTransport` — author factory

The single new primitive. Authors implement `client(options) → RuntimeTransportClient` and `host(options) → RuntimeTransportHost`. The runtime never inspects the transport's internals; it calls a small, stable interface.

Detailed TypeScript follows in the next section.

### Bundled transports

```typescript
// In-process: kernel runs on the calling thread. For tests, CLI single-process, SSR rendering.
inProcessTransport({ fileSystem })

// Browser Web Worker: kernel runs in a Worker created from the bundler-friendly URL.
webWorkerTransport({
  url: new URL('./kernel-worker.ts', import.meta.url),
  fileSystem,
  geometry: { poolBytes?: number },   // default 64 MB
  files: { poolBytes?: number },       // default 8 MB
  abort: { signalSlot?: boolean },     // default true (uses SAB Atomics + wire notify)
})

// Node worker_threads: kernel runs in a Worker created from a file URL.
nodeWorkerTransport({
  url: new URL('./kernel-worker.js', import.meta.url),
  fileSystem,
  geometry?, files?, abort?,
})
```

All three options-shapes follow the same skeleton. The transport defaults to the most aggressive performance path its wire supports; consumer options exist only to **degrade** (e.g. for testing the copy path on a SAB-capable wire) — they never escalate.

### `RuntimeFileSystem` factories (`fromX`)

```typescript
// In-memory FS suitable for testing and lightweight playgrounds.
fromMemoryFs(initialFiles?: Record<string, string | Uint8Array>): RuntimeFileSystem

// Node disk FS rooted at a project path.
fromNodeFs(rootPath: string): RuntimeFileSystem

// Browser File System Access API (origin-private or user-granted handle).
fromBrowserFs(rootHandle: FileSystemDirectoryHandle): RuntimeFileSystem

// Adapter that wraps any FsLike implementation (memfs, ZenFS, etc.).
fromFsLike(fsLike: FsLike): RuntimeFileSystem

// Bridged FS: forwards reads/writes/watches over a Channel<FsProtocol>
// to a remote authority. Only used inside transport implementations and
// in tests; not on the consumer-facing API surface.
fromChannelFs(channel: Channel<FsProtocol>): RuntimeFileSystem
```

The shape `RuntimeFileSystem` is opaque — there is no public `kind` discriminator and no public `port` accessor. The transport, given a `RuntimeFileSystem`, decides how to expose it to the kernel host (inline if same isolate, channel-bridged if different). The legacy `RuntimeFileSystemHandle` discriminated union (`{ kind: 'inline' | 'channel', port }`) is **deleted** because it leaks `MessagePort` (a wire primitive) onto the public option type.

### Kernel plugins (`createKernelPlugin` + `defineKernel`)

Unchanged from current code. Kernels are a two-layer plugin: the **plugin entry** (registered in `createRuntimeClient`) and the **kernel module** (loaded inside the host worker via `moduleUrl`). Both layers stay exactly as they exist today.

```typescript
// replicad.plugin.ts — plugin entry (registered in createRuntimeClient)
import { createKernelPlugin } from '@taucad/runtime';
import {
  replicadOptionsSchema,
  replicadRenderSchema,
  replicadExportSchemas,
  replicadDetectPattern,
} from './replicad.schemas.js';

export const replicad = createKernelPlugin({
  id: 'replicad',
  moduleUrl: new URL('replicad.kernel.js', import.meta.url).href,
  extensions: ['ts', 'js'],
  detectImport: replicadDetectPattern,
  builtinModuleNames: ['replicad'],
  optionsSchema: replicadOptionsSchema, // Options inferred via z.input
  renderSchema: replicadRenderSchema, // RenderOptions inferred via z.input
  exportSchemas: replicadExportSchemas, // FormatMap inferred per-format
});
// Inferred: (options?: ReplicadOptions) => KernelPlugin<FormatMap, RenderOptions, 'replicad'>

const k = replicad({ wasm: 'single' });
```

```typescript
// replicad.kernel.ts — kernel module (loaded inside the host worker via moduleUrl)
import { defineKernel } from '@taucad/runtime/kernels';
import { replicadOptionsSchema, replicadRenderSchema, replicadExportSchemas } from './replicad.schemas.js';

export default defineKernel({
  name: 'Replicad',
  version: '1.0.0',
  optionsSchema: replicadOptionsSchema, // runtime validation + Options generic inference
  renderSchema: replicadRenderSchema, // runtime validation + RenderOptions generic inference
  exportSchemas: replicadExportSchemas, // runtime validation + FormatMap generic inference
  initialize: async (input) => {
    /* ... */
  },
  createGeometry: async (input) => {
    /* ... */
  },
  exportGeometry: async (input) => {
    /* ... */
  },
  // ... lifecycle methods
});
```

Two important corrections to the v5 mental model retained here:

1. There is **no `worker` field on `KernelPlugin`.** Workers are spawned by the **transport**, not the kernel plugin. The plugin only declares `moduleUrl` (the URL the worker should `import()` to load the kernel module). When the consumer picks `webWorkerTransport`, the transport's host-side script imports every registered kernel's `moduleUrl` and constructs the dispatcher against them.
2. `defineKernel` is **not** the plugin factory — it is the kernel module factory used **inside** the worker. `createKernelPlugin` is the plugin entry registered with `createRuntimeClient`. The naming difference is intentional: `defineX` produces a definition consumed by infrastructure (the dispatcher), `createXPlugin` produces a registerable plugin object consumed by composition (`createRuntimeClient`).

The two layers share Zod schemas via the `*.schemas.ts` co-location pattern (per [`generic-inference-pipeline.md`](./generic-inference-pipeline.md)) — one schema declaration, used both for plugin-side type inference and worker-side runtime validation. The same pattern is adopted for transports below (see [Wire Protocol Validation](#wire-protocol-validation-zod-schemas)).

### `defineBundler`, `defineTranscoder`, `defineMiddleware`

Unchanged plugin shapes (`createBundlerPlugin`, `createTranscoderPlugin`, `createMiddlewarePlugin`). They compose into `createRuntimeClient` / `createRuntimeHost` orthogonally to the transport. `TranscoderPlugin` carries phantom generics analogous to `KernelPlugin` (`EdgeMap`, `From`, `Id`); `BundlerPlugin` and `MiddlewarePlugin` are presently un-generic and stay that way.

### Channel primitives (`@taucad/rpc`)

Used only by transport plugin authors (and by the FS bridge).

```typescript
import { wrapMessagePort, createChannelClient, createChannelServer } from '@taucad/rpc';
import type { Channel, ChannelServer } from '@taucad/rpc';

const port = wrapMessagePort<RuntimeProtocol>(messagePort);
const channel = createChannelClient<RuntimeProtocol>(port, { sessionKey: 'tau.runtime/v1' });

const server = createChannelServer<RuntimeProtocol>(port, {
  sessionKey: 'tau.runtime/v1',
  calls: { initialize, export: exportImpl },
  notifies: { abort, render, openFile, stageAndRender },
});
```

Note: **`PortCapabilities` is removed from the public `Port<T>` shape** in v6. `wrapMessagePort` no longer accepts a `capabilities` argument. Every consumer of `Port` (including `Channel`) treats every wire as supporting structured clone only; the _transport_ adds optimisation strategies on top, not the port adapter.

## `defineRuntimeTransport` — Concrete TypeScript

This is the central new primitive. The full proposed type set follows. Every public type carries phantom generics so end-to-end inference works without a single explicit type parameter at the consumer site (per Finding 9 and [`generic-inference-pipeline.md`](./generic-inference-pipeline.md)). Read this section alongside [Generic Type Inference Pipeline](#generic-type-inference-pipeline) and [Wire Protocol Validation](#wire-protocol-validation-zod-schemas) — they explain _why_ the shapes look the way they do.

### Phantom carriers

Five `unique symbol` carriers, mirroring the pattern used by `KernelPlugin` (`__exportSchemas`, `__renderSchema`, `__kernelId`) and `TranscoderPlugin` (`__transcodeEdges`, `__transcodeFrom`, `__transcoderId`). None of the symbols carry runtime values; all are `readonly … ?` properties consumed only by the type system.

```typescript
// packages/runtime/src/transport/runtime-transport.types.ts (NEW)

/** Phantom carrier for the transport's literal id. */
declare const __transportId: unique symbol;

/** Phantom carrier for the transport's wire protocol map. */
declare const __transportProtocol: unique symbol;

/** Phantom carrier for per-transport host bindings extension shape. */
declare const __transportBindingsExtra: unique symbol;

/** Phantom carrier for client-side options shape (inferred from clientOptionsSchema). */
declare const __transportClientOptions: unique symbol;

/** Phantom carrier for host-side options shape (inferred from hostOptionsSchema). */
declare const __transportHostOptions: unique symbol;
```

### Per-plugin tuple aggregators

Mirroring `CollectFormatMap` / `CollectKernelIds` / `KnownTranscoderIds`, two aggregators project from a single transport plugin slot. They exist for `RuntimeClient`/`RuntimeHost` to surface the transport's identity and bindings extras through the typed client surface.

```typescript
// packages/runtime/src/transport/transport-projections.ts (NEW)

/** Extracts the literal transport id from a transport plugin. */
export type TransportId<T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, any, any, any>> =
  T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, infer Id, any, any> ? Id : never;

/** Extracts the bindings-extra shape from a transport plugin. */
export type TransportBindingsExtra<T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, any, any, any>> =
  T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, infer B, any, any, any> ? B : never;

/** Extracts the wire protocol map from a transport plugin. */
export type TransportProtocol<T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, any, any, any>> =
  T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<infer P, any, any, any, any> ? P : never;

/** Extracts the client-side options shape from a transport plugin. */
export type TransportClientOptions<T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, any, any, any>> =
  T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, any, infer O, any> ? O : never;

/** Extracts the host-side options shape from a transport plugin. */
export type TransportHostOptions<T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, any, any, any>> =
  T extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, any, any, infer O> ? O : never;
```

### `RuntimeClient` generic surface

The client carries the transport's phantom into the surface, joining it with the existing `Kernels` / `Transcoders` bag.

```typescript
// packages/runtime/src/client/runtime-client.ts (MODIFIED)

export type RuntimeClient<
  Kernels extends readonly KernelPlugin<any, any, any>[] = readonly KernelPlugin<any, any, any>[],
  Transcoders extends readonly TranscoderPlugin<any, any, any>[] = readonly TranscoderPlugin<any, any, any>[],
  Transport extends RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, any, any, any> = RuntimeTransportPlugin<any, any, any, any, any>,
> = {
  // ... existing surface (unchanged) ...

  /** Diagnostic descriptor of the active transport. */
  readonly transport: {
    readonly id: TransportId<Transport>;
    readonly descriptor: TransportDescriptor<TransportId<Transport>>;
  };

  // ... existing methods (export, openFile, etc.) — unchanged ...
};
```

Consumer call sites stay zero-annotation:

```typescript
const client = createRuntimeClient({
  kernels: [replicad(), openscad()], // KernelPlugin tuple inferred
  transcoders: [converterTranscoder()], // TranscoderPlugin tuple inferred
  transport: webWorkerTransport({ url, fileSystem: fromMemoryFs() }),
  // RuntimeTransportPlugin<RuntimeProtocol, {}, 'web-worker', WebWorkerOptions, {}> inferred
});

// client.transport.id has literal type 'web-worker'
// client.transport.descriptor has type TransportDescriptor<'web-worker'>
// client.export('stl', { binary: true }) — full per-format inference unchanged
```

### What the runtime calls

The runtime client interacts with `RuntimeTransportClient` through exactly five methods:

| Method                | Called when                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open()`              | Once, during `client.connect()`.                                                                      |
| `initialize(payload)` | Once, immediately after `open()` resolves. Carries kernel/middleware/bundler/transcoder declarations. |
| `abort(reason)`       | When the consumer cancels a render via `client.abort()`.                                              |
| `resolveGeometry(t)`  | Per `geometryComputed` notify, to materialise the encoded form into a `Geometry`.                     |
| `close(reason?)`      | Once, during `client.terminate()`.                                                                    |

The runtime client also reads `transport.channel` from `TransportClientReady` to issue the application-level calls (`initialize`, `export`, etc.) and notifies (`render`, `openFile`, `stageAndRender`, etc.). Because `Channel<RuntimeProtocol>` is fully typed, the runtime never sees raw envelopes.

### What the host calls

Inside a kernel-host script the dispatcher is constructed against `RuntimeTransportHost`:

```typescript
// Inside a worker / utility-process entry
const hostTransport = electronUtilityHost();
const { channel } = await hostTransport.open();

const dispatcher = createWorkerDispatcher({
  hostTransport,
  channel,
  kernels: [replicad()],
});

// dispatcher registers handlers on the channel, drains initialize, and
// publishes geometry frames using hostTransport.encodeGeometry(...).
```

The dispatcher never directly sees the wire. It calls `hostTransport.encodeGeometry(g)` to produce the typed `EncodedGeometry` and then calls `channel.notify('geometryComputed', { result, rgen })` with the descriptor. The transport intercepts the notify on the way to the wire and supplies the right transferables list. (Concretely: the host transport wraps `channel.notify` to inject the `WithTransferables<T>` envelope; alternatively the dispatcher can call `hostTransport.publishGeometryComputed(rgen, geometry)` and let the transport own the whole frame. The blueprint adopts the second shape for clarity — see Channel Messages below.)

### Initialize envelope policy

The current code path:

```typescript
// Today: runtime-worker-client.ts assembles the envelope
const memoryHandle: InitializeMemoryHandle = { signalBuffer, geometryPoolBuffer, filePoolBuffer, fileSystemPort };
const transferables = fileSystemPort ? [fileSystemPort] : [];
await this.channel.call('initialize', { ...args, memoryHandle }, { transferables });
```

The v6 policy:

```typescript
// Tomorrow: runtime-worker-client.ts asks the transport
await this.transport.initialize({
  options,
  middlewareEntries,
  bundlerEntries,
  transcoderModules,
});

// inside the transport:
//   1. Allocate SAB if the wire supports it (geometry pool, file pool, signal slot).
//   2. Construct an FS bridge port (or pass inline) per the FileSystem source.
//   3. Build memoryHandle and transferables internally.
//   4. Call channel.call('initialize', { ...payload, memoryHandle }, { transferables }).
//   5. Return CapabilitiesManifest from the response.
```

The wire-level facts (which SABs exist, which transferables to pass) never cross back into runtime code.

## Generic Type Inference Pipeline

The transport layer adopts the same generic-inference contract as the kernel and transcoder layers. This section formalises _which_ generics flow _where_ and _what guarantees_ the consumer gets. It is the "shared generics inventory" the user requested — both as a table and as a set of conformance rules.

### Shared generics inventory

| **Transcoder source format** | `TranscoderPlugin<_, From, _>` via `__transcodeFrom`                               | `MergeExportMap<…>` source-format intersection                             | `createTranscoderPlugin({ from: 'glb' })` — `const From` slot.                                                          |
| **Transcoder id**            | `TranscoderPlugin<_, _, Id>` via `__transcoderId`                                  | `manifest.routes[].transcoderId` typing                                    | `createTranscoderPlugin({ id: 'converter' })` — `const Id` slot.                                                        |
| **Transport protocol**       | `RuntimeTransportPlugin<Protocol, _, _, _, _>` via `__transportProtocol`           | `Channel<Protocol>` typed RPC inside transport implementations             | `defineRuntimeTransport({ protocol })` — explicit when overriding the default `RuntimeProtocol`.                        |
| **Transport bindings extra** | `RuntimeTransportPlugin<_, BindingsExtra, _, _, _>` via `__transportBindingsExtra` | `HostInitializeBindings<BindingsExtra>` returned by `host.adoptInitialize` | Inferred from the `host` factory's return shape; the dispatcher reads the merged bindings at runtime.                   |
| **Transport id**             | `RuntimeTransportPlugin<_, _, Id, _, _>` via `__transportId`                       | `client.transport.id`, `TransportDescriptor<Id>`                           | `defineRuntimeTransport({ id: 'web-worker' })` — `const Id` slot on the factory.                                        |
| **Transport client opts**    | `RuntimeTransportPlugin<_, _, _, ClientOptions, _>` via `__transportClientOptions` | `webWorkerTransport(options)` consumer call site                           | `defineRuntimeTransport({ clientOptionsSchema })` — via `z.input`. When no schema, the `client` factory parameter type. |
| **Transport host opts**      | `RuntimeTransportPlugin<_, _, _, _, HostOptions>` via `__transportHostOptions`     | `webWorkerHost(options)` host script call site                             | `defineRuntimeTransport({ hostOptionsSchema })` — via `z.input`. When no schema, the `host` factory parameter type.     |

Every seam follows the same three-step pattern:

1. **Schema is the source of truth** (Zod, when applicable) — drives both compile-time inference (`z.input`) and runtime validation.
2. **Phantom carrier preserves the type** through generic erasure barriers (e.g. tuple aggregation, plugin registration).
3. **Projection helper reads the carrier** at the consumer surface (e.g. `CollectFormatMap`, `TransportId`).

                              >
```

The arrow direction is consistent across both the kernel and transport pipelines: schema → factory infers types → plugin carries phantoms → client surfaces narrowed types. **No explicit type parameters at any consumer site.**

### Why phantoms (and not class-style declared fields)

`KernelPlugin` / `TranscoderPlugin` / `RuntimeTransportPlugin` are plain object types, not classes. The phantoms are `readonly [unique symbol] ?: T` properties so:

- Runtime values omit the phantom field (it's optional and never assigned).
- Type-level code reads the phantom via conditional inference (`P extends Plugin<infer X, …> ? X : never`).
- Object spread / clone preserves the phantom (since it's never assigned, it never appears, but the type system tracks it as part of the inferred shape).

Per [`typescript-policy.md`](../policy/typescript-policy.md) §6, phantom information lost at one seam cascades into wide-default unions at every downstream consumer. The sentinel tests in `define-plugin.test-d.ts` lock in the existing kernel/transcoder phantoms; v6 adds `define-transport.test-d.ts` to lock in the transport phantoms (see [Appendix B](#appendix-b--conformance-tests) C12).

### What the consumer sees

Consumer DX after v6:

```typescript
const client = createRuntimeClient({
  kernels: [replicad(), openscad()] as const,
  transcoders: [converterTranscoder()] as const,
  transport: webWorkerTransport({ url, fileSystem: fromMemoryFs() }),
});

// Per-kernel literal id narrowing:
client.transport.id;
//             ^? 'web-worker'

// Per-format options narrowing across kernel + transcoder formats:
await client.export('stl', { binary: true });
//                                ^^^^^^ inferred as boolean from replicadExportSchemas.stl
await client.export('usdz', { units: 'meter' });
//                                    ^^^^^^^ inferred from converter's usdz edge schema, merged with replicad's glb source format
await client.export('xyz');
//                  ^^^ Type error: 'xyz' is not a valid export format

// Per-kernel render options narrowing:
await client.openFile({ file: { path: 'main.ts' }, parameters: { tessellation: { linearTolerance: 0.01 } } });
//                                                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ from replicadRenderSchema
```

Zero `as` assertions, zero explicit type parameters, full per-position narrowing. This is the contract v6 commits to.

## Reference Transport Implementations

### `inProcessTransport`

Same isolate; no wire crossing. Uses an internal `MessageChannel` so the channel protocol stays uniform — this keeps tests the same shape as production paths. Schemas are co-located (`in-process-transport.schemas.ts`) and drive both type inference and runtime validation.

```typescript
// packages/runtime/src/transport/in-process-transport.schemas.ts (NEW)

import { runtimeFileSystemSchema } from '#filesystem/runtime-filesystem.schemas.js';

export const inProcessClientOptionsSchema = z.object({
  fileSystem: runtimeFileSystemSchema,
  geometry: z
    .object({
      poolBytes: z
        .number()
        .positive()
        .default(64 * 1024 * 1024),
    })
    .default({}),
  files: z
    .object({
      poolBytes: z
        .number()
        .positive()
        .default(8 * 1024 * 1024),
    })
    .default({}),
});

### `nodeWorkerTransport`

Mirrors `webWorkerTransport` against `node:worker_threads`. Differences are isolated to the wire setup (`new Worker(filename)` instead of `new Worker(url)`) and the FS bridge — Node always supports SAB and `MessagePort` transfer between workers, so the SAB paths are unconditional.

### `electronUtilityTransport` (example-owned)

Lives in `examples/electron-tau/src/transport/electron-utility-transport.ts`. Authored using `defineRuntimeTransport`. The `bootstrap` option is a callback the renderer-side client invokes to ask the main process for a `MessagePortMain` connected to the utility-process kernel host; the consumer wires `bootstrap` against their own preload bridge.

The Electron transport is also the prototypical case for a non-trivial `BindingsExtra` shape — the host side might want to expose, for example, the parent process's `parentPort` reference for diagnostics or a future native-addon registry. The example below declares an empty extras (`{}`) for now; the type system supports growth without modifying the runtime core.

```typescript
// examples/electron-tau/src/transport/electron-utility-transport.schemas.ts (NEW)

import { z } from 'zod';

export const electronUtilityClientOptionsSchema = z.object({
  bootstrap: z
    .function()
    .args()
    .returns(z.promise(z.instanceof(MessagePort))),
  geometry: z
    .object({
      poolBytes: z
        .number()
        .positive()
        .default(64 * 1024 * 1024),
    })
    .default({}),
  files: z
    .object({
      poolBytes: z
        .number()
        .positive()
        .default(8 * 1024 * 1024),
    })
    .default({}),
});

export const electronUtilityHostOptionsSchema = z.object({
  fileSystem: runtimeFileSystemSchema,
});
```

```typescript
// examples/electron-tau/src/transport/electron-utility-transport.ts (NEW)

import { defineRuntimeTransport } from '@taucad/runtime/transport';
import {
  electronUtilityClientOptionsSchema,
  electronUtilityHostOptionsSchema,
} from './electron-utility-transport.schemas.js';

export const electronUtilityTransport = defineRuntimeTransport({
  id: 'electron-utility', // literal id
  clientOptionsSchema: electronUtilityClientOptionsSchema, // ClientOptions inferred
  hostOptionsSchema: electronUtilityHostOptionsSchema, // HostOptions inferred
  client(options) {
    // Renderer side. Asks `options.bootstrap()` for a relayed
    // MessagePort, wraps it as a Channel, allocates SAB pools (Electron
    // utilityProcess ports support SAB end-to-end once relayed past the
    // renderer↔main boundary), and serves the runtime contract.
    // ...
  },
  host(options) {
    // Utility-process side. Uses process.parentPort to receive the
    // initial port, constructs the channel server, and bridges the
    // local FS supplied via options.fileSystem.
    // ...
  },
});
// Inferred:
//   RuntimeTransportPlugin<
//     RuntimeProtocol, {}, 'electron-utility',
//     z.input<typeof electronUtilityClientOptionsSchema>,
//     z.input<typeof electronUtilityHostOptionsSchema>
//   >
```

The Electron transport is the only bundled-or-example transport that requires a consumer-supplied `bootstrap`, because the relay through `main` is application-specific (preload bridge + `webContents.postMessage` + `utilityProcess.fork`). Browser and Node transports own their entire lifecycle.

## Wire Protocol Validation (Zod Schemas)

The runtime protocol is authored as Zod schemas, mirroring the kernel pattern. This is a deliberate elevation of the existing TypeScript-only `RuntimeProtocol` declarations: schemas become the single source of truth for both compile-time inference and runtime validation, and the channel server validates every received frame at the wire boundary. The cost is small (a few microseconds per frame, dwarfed by the kernel work that follows) and the benefit is large (mismatched runtime versions, malformed payloads, and renderer-side type drift all fail loudly at the boundary instead of silently corrupting later).

### Schema co-location

```typescript
// packages/runtime/src/types/runtime-protocol.schemas.ts (NEW)

import { z } from 'zod';

// ---------- Memory handle (transport-supplied attachments) ----------

export const runtimeInitializeMemoryHandleSchema = z.object({
  signalBuffer: z.instanceof(SharedArrayBuffer).optional(),

  options: runtimeInitializeOptionsSchema,
  middlewareEntries: z.array(middlewareEntrySchema),
  bundlerEntries: z.array(bundlerEntrySchema),
  transcoderModules: z.array(transcoderModuleSchema),
  memoryHandle: runtimeInitializeMemoryHandleSchema,
});

export const runtimeInitializeResultSchema = z.object({
  capabilities: capabilitiesManifestSchema,
});

// ---------- Export call ----------

export const runtimeExportArgsSchema = z.object({
  format: fileExtensionSchema,
  options: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional(),
});

export const runtimeExportResultSchema = z.object({
  bytes: z.instanceof(Uint8Array),
  format: fileExtensionSchema,
});

// ---------- Notifies (consumer → host) ----------

export const runtimeRenderArgsSchema = z.object({
  file: geometryFileSchema,
  parameters: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()),
  options: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional(),
});

export const runtimeAbortArgsSchema = z.object({
  reason: abortReasonSchema,
});

export const runtimeOpenFileArgsSchema = z.object({
  file: geometryFileSchema,
  parameters: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()),
  options: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional(),
});

export const runtimeStageAndRenderArgsSchema = z.object({
  stage: z.record(z.string(), z.instanceof(Uint8Array)),
  file: geometryFileSchema,
  parameters: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()),
  options: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional(),
});

export const runtimeGetKernelResultArgsSchema = z.object({
  rgen: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
});

// ---------- Notifies (host → consumer) ----------

export const runtimeProgressArgsSchema = z.object({
  phase: renderPhaseSchema,
  rgen: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
  detail: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional(),
});

export const runtimeGeometryComputedArgsSchema = z.object({
  result: hashedGeometryResultTransportSchema,
  rgen: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
});

export const runtimeParametersResolvedArgsSchema = z.object({
  result: getParametersResultSchema,
  rgen: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
});

export const runtimeErrorEventArgsSchema = z.object({
  issues: z.array(kernelIssueSchema),
  rgen: z.number().int().nonnegative().optional(),
});

export const runtimeKernelResultArgsSchema = z.object({
  rgen: z.number().int().nonnegative(),
  result: kernelResultSchema,
});

// ---------- Hello payload ----------

export const transportHelloPayloadSchema = z.object({
  server: z.literal('kernel-runtime-worker'),
  runtimeVersion: z.string(),
  transportId: z.string(),
});

// ---------- The protocol map ----------

export const runtimeProtocolSchemas = {
  calls: {
    initialize: { args: runtimeInitializeArgsSchema, result: runtimeInitializeResultSchema },
    export: { args: runtimeExportArgsSchema, result: runtimeExportResultSchema },
  },
  notifies: {
    // consumer → host
    render: runtimeRenderArgsSchema,
    abort: runtimeAbortArgsSchema,
    openFile: runtimeOpenFileArgsSchema,
    stageAndRender: runtimeStageAndRenderArgsSchema,
    getKernelResult: runtimeGetKernelResultArgsSchema,

    // host → consumer
    progress: runtimeProgressArgsSchema,
    geometryComputed: runtimeGeometryComputedArgsSchema,
    parametersResolved: runtimeParametersResolvedArgsSchema,
    errorEvent: runtimeErrorEventArgsSchema,
    kernelResult: runtimeKernelResultArgsSchema,
  },
} as const satisfies WireProtocolSchemas;
```

```typescript
// packages/runtime/src/types/runtime-protocol.types.ts (MODIFIED — derives from schemas)

import type {
  runtimeInitializeArgsSchema,
  runtimeInitializeResultSchema,
  // ...
} from './runtime-protocol.schemas.js';

export type RuntimeInitializeArgs = z.input<typeof runtimeInitializeArgsSchema>;
export type RuntimeInitializeResult = z.output<typeof runtimeInitializeResultSchema>;
export type RuntimeExportArgs = z.input<typeof runtimeExportArgsSchema>;
// ... etc

// Protocol map type derived from the schemas
export type RuntimeProtocol = InferProtocol<typeof runtimeProtocolSchemas>;
```

The runtime protocol type alias **derives from the schemas**, not the other way around. There is no path where a TypeScript `RuntimeProtocol` declaration drifts from a Zod schema implementation — they are the same value, expressed once.

### Channel server validation

The channel server accepts an optional `protocolSchemas` argument; when supplied, it validates received call args, call results, and notify args at the wire boundary using `schema.parse(rawValue)`. Validation throws a `WireValidationError` (with the Zod issue list) which the channel propagates to the caller as a typed RPC error.

```typescript
// packages/rpc/src/channel.ts (MODIFIED)

export type ChannelServerOptions<Protocol extends RpcProtocol> = {
  readonly sessionKey: string;
  readonly calls: { [K in keyof Protocol['calls']]: ProtocolCallHandler<Protocol['calls'][K]> };
  readonly notifies: { [K in keyof Protocol['notifies']]: ProtocolNotifyHandler<Protocol['notifies'][K]> };
  /**
   * Optional Zod schemas for per-call/per-notify validation at the wire
   * boundary. When supplied, the channel parses every received args
   * payload before invoking the handler. When omitted, the channel trusts
   * the wire (used for transports that are within the same trust boundary
   * as the host, e.g. in-process for tests).
   */
  readonly protocolSchemas?: WireProtocolSchemas<Protocol>;
};
```

The channel client similarly accepts an optional `protocolSchemas` argument and validates received call results / notify args on the consumer side.

### Trust-boundary policy

| Wire                       | Validate inbound? | Reasoning                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inProcessTransport`       | Optional          | Same isolate, single build — drift impossible. Default off in prod, on in tests.                  |
| `webWorkerTransport`       | Yes               | Same origin / same build, but the worker is loaded from a URL and could be a stale cached bundle. |
| `nodeWorkerTransport`      | Yes               | Same process, but the worker file may be loaded from a different package version in monorepos.    |
| `electronUtilityTransport` | Yes               | Cross-process. Different binary, different lifetime — version drift is plausible.                 |
| Future remote transports   | Yes               | Untrusted boundary. Validation is mandatory.                                                      |

### Why Zod (and not JSON Schema, ts-runtime, io-ts, ArkType)

- **Already a runtime dep.** Kernels use Zod for `optionsSchema` / `renderSchema` / `exportSchemas`. No new dependency.
- **Single source of truth.** `z.input` / `z.output` derive types directly from the schema.
- **Co-location pattern works.** Schemas live in `*.schemas.ts` next to types, exactly as kernel schemas do.
- **Error UX.** Zod's `issues` array gives precise per-field errors that surface cleanly through `WireValidationError`.
- **Custom checks.** `z.instanceof(SharedArrayBuffer)` / `z.instanceof(MessagePort)` cover the wire-primitive edge cases without bespoke validators.

### What Zod does _not_ validate

- **Transferables list.** Transferables are an out-of-band postMessage argument, not part of the cloneable payload. Channel-layer concern; the channel asserts at construction (e.g. `instanceof MessagePort` for declared transferable slots).
- **SAB content.** SABs are passed through; their internal data is owned by whoever wrote it (typically the SharedPool implementation).
- **Hello version compatibility.** `transportHelloPayloadSchema` validates the _shape_; runtime-version mismatch is detected by the channel hello logic, not by schema validation.

## Channel Messages on the Wire

The channel protocol is unchanged from v5. `Channel<RuntimeProtocol>` provides:

| Primitive            | Wire frame                                                                | Used for                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `call`               | `{ k: 'rq', id, n, a }` ↔ `{ k: 'rs', id, ok, v? / e? }`                  | Request/response with a result. Used for `initialize`, `export`.                                                                                                                                 |
| `notify`             | `{ k: 'nt', n, a }`                                                       | Fire-and-forget event. Used for `render`, `abort`, `openFile`, `stageAndRender`, `geometryComputed`, `progress`, `errorEvent`, `parametersResolved`, `getKernelResultRequested`, `kernelResult`. |

| `listen`             | `{ k: 'sub', id, n, a }` … `{ k: 'snx', id, v }` … `{ k: 'sec', id, e? }` | Streaming subscription. Used by FS bridge `watch`. Not used by the runtime protocol; kept because deletion would force the FS bridge to reimplement queueing.                                    |
| `lh` / `lho` / `lhe` | Hello / hello-ok / hello-error                                            | Lifecycle: protocol version + sessionKey check + transport hello payload.                                                                                                                        |

The minimum runtime protocol surface the v6 plan uses:

```typescript
type RuntimeProtocol = {
  calls: {
    initialize: (args: RuntimeInitializeArgs) => RuntimeInitializeResult;
    export: (args: RuntimeExportArgs) => RuntimeExportResult;
  };
  notifies: {
    // Consumer → host
    render: (args: RuntimeRenderArgs) => void;
    openFile: (args: RuntimeOpenFileArgs) => void;
    stageAndRender: (args: RuntimeStageAndRenderArgs) => void;
    abort: (args: { reason: AbortReason }) => void;
    getKernelResult: (args: RuntimeGetKernelResultArgs) => void;

    // Host → consumer
    progress: (args: RuntimeProgressArgs) => void;
    geometryComputed: (args: RuntimeGeometryComputedArgs) => void;
    parametersResolved: (args: RuntimeParametersResolvedArgs) => void;
    errorEvent: (args: RuntimeErrorEventArgs) => void;
    kernelResult: (args: RuntimeKernelResultArgs) => void;
  };
};
```

No `listen` subscriptions live on the runtime protocol. The FS bridge protocol (`FsProtocol`) uses `listen` for `watch` — that lives in `@taucad/runtime/filesystem-bridge`, not in the runtime protocol surface.

### Wire shapes per call

#### `initialize`

```jsonc
// Request (consumer → host)
{
  "k": "rq",
  "id": "init-1",
  "n": "initialize",
  "a": {
    "options": {
      /* RuntimeInitializeOptions */
    },
    "middlewareEntries": [
      /* ... */
    ],
    "bundlerEntries": [
      /* ... */
    ],
    "transcoderModules": [
      /* ... */
    ],
    "memoryHandle": {
      "signalBuffer": "<SharedArrayBuffer>", // structured-clone shared
      "geometryPoolBuffer": "<SharedArrayBuffer>", // structured-clone shared
      "filePoolBuffer": "<SharedArrayBuffer>", // structured-clone shared
      "fileSystemPort": "<MessagePort>", // transferable
    },
  },
}
// Wire envelope additionally carries the transferables list at the
// postMessage layer: postMessage(frame, [fileSystemPort])
```

```jsonc
// Response (host → consumer)
{
  "k": "rs",
  "id": "init-1",
  "ok": true,
  "v": {
    "capabilities": {
      /* CapabilitiesManifest */
    },
  },
}
```

The `memoryHandle` fields are populated by the **transport** based on what its wire supports. A `webSocketTransport` would ship `{}` (no SAB, no port transfer); the dispatcher's `adoptInitialize` returns appropriate fallbacks (`abortSignal` wrapping a wire-notify-driven controller, etc.).

#### `geometryComputed`

```jsonc
// Notify (host → consumer)
{
  "k": "nt",
  "n": "geometryComputed",
  "a": {
    "result": {
      "delivery": "pooled", // OR "transfer" OR "inline"
      "key": "geo-abc123", // OR { delivery: "transfer", bytes: <Uint8Array> }
      // OR { delivery: "inline", bytes: <Uint8Array> }
    },
    "rgen": 7,
  },
}
```

The host transport's `encodeGeometry` decides which delivery to use. The consumer transport's `resolveGeometry` materialises it back into a `Geometry`. The runtime never sees `pooled`/`transfer`/`copy` keywords directly — it just calls `transport.resolveGeometry(t)` and gets a `Geometry`.

#### `abort`

```jsonc
// Notify (consumer → host)
{
  "k": "nt",
  "n": "abort",
  "a": { "reason": "user-cancelled" },
}
```

In addition, transports with a `signalBuffer` perform `Atomics.store(slot, 0, 1); Atomics.notify(slot, 0)` _before_ sending the wire notify so a host blocked inside a `wait()` wakes immediately. Wire-only transports rely on the notify alone.

#### `render`

```jsonc
// Notify (consumer → host)
{
  "k": "nt",
  "n": "render",
  "a": {
    "file": { "path": "/main.ts", "bytes": "<Uint8Array>" },
    "parameters": {
      /* user values */
    },
    "options": {
      /* render options */
    },
  },
}
```

#### Hello

```jsonc
// Wire frame (either side)
{
  "k": "lh",
  "v": "1.0.0", // protocol version
  "s": "tau.runtime/v1", // sessionKey
  "d": {
    "server": "kernel-runtime-worker",
    "runtimeVersion": "1.42.3",
    "transportId": "web-worker",
  },
}
```

Each transport identifies itself in `d.transportId`. The hello payload carries no capability bits — capabilities are not part of the wire contract.

## Files to Delete

These files are explicitly slated for deletion in the v6 cutover. The list is exhaustive — anything not in this table or in _Files to Add_ stays as-is.

Note: `Port.capabilities` is removed from `packages/rpc/src/port.ts` but the file stays (the `Port<T>` adapter is kept). This is a _modification_, not a deletion.

### Code that stays but materially changes

These files are not deleted but their contents change substantively as part of the v6 cutover. Listed here so planning work knows where the work lands.

- `packages/runtime/src/client/runtime-client.ts` — drops `connect({ port, fileSystem })` shape; gains `transport` field on `RuntimeClientOptions`.
- `packages/runtime/src/framework/runtime-worker-client.ts` — collapses `initialize()` to delegate to `transport.initialize()`.
- `packages/runtime/src/framework/runtime-worker-dispatcher.ts` — `readDeliveryCapabilities(port)` is replaced with `hostTransport.encodeGeometry()`.
- `packages/runtime/src/framework/runtime-message-adapter.ts` — `getWorkerMessagePort()` is removed (its code moves into `webWorkerHost()` and `nodeWorkerHost()`).
- `packages/rpc/src/port.ts` — removes the `capabilities` field from `Port<T>`; `wrapMessagePort` stops accepting `capabilities`.
- `packages/rpc/src/channel.ts` — stops reading `port.capabilities`; tier choices are made by the transport, not the channel.

## Migration Path from v5

The v5 → v6 migration is a single coordinated PR (no shims, no aliases — consistent with the project's "roll forward with breaking changes" preference). Steps in implementation order:

1. **Lift the runtime protocol into Zod schemas.** Author `runtime-protocol.schemas.ts` matching the existing `RuntimeProtocol` shape exactly; rewire `runtime-protocol.types.ts` to derive types via `z.input` / `z.output`. No behaviour changes yet — the schemas are unused by the channel.
2. **Add `WireProtocolSchemas<P>` and channel validation.** Extend `ChannelServerOptions` / `ChannelClientOptions` to accept an optional `protocolSchemas` field; validation at receive becomes one `schema.parse(rawValue)` call. Default off so v5 paths still work.
3. **Add the new primitive surface alongside v5.** New files under `packages/runtime/src/transport/`, new opaque `RuntimeFileSystem` factories, the `defineRuntimeTransport` factory with all phantom generics. v5 paths still work.
4. **Migrate `RuntimeClient` / `RuntimeHost`.** `createRuntimeClient` accepts `transport` _as well as_ the legacy `runner` + `connect({ port })`. Internal client routes through `transport` when present. The `RuntimeClient` type gains the `Transport` generic slot.
5. **Migrate the in-process tests.** Switch `inProcessRunner()` call-sites to `inProcessTransport({ fileSystem })`. Verify the in-process transport test suite passes.
6. **Migrate the web-worker tests.** Switch `webWorkerRunner` + `connect({ port })` to `webWorkerTransport({ url, fileSystem })`.
7. **Migrate the node-worker tests.** Same as above for `nodeWorkerTransport`.
8. **Migrate the example Electron PoC.** Replace the per-file adapter wiring with `electronUtilityTransport`. Verify the e2e Playwright test passes.
9. **Migrate `apps/ui`.** Switch all `createRuntimeClient` call sites to the transport shape.
10. **Enable wire-protocol validation by default.** Flip the bundled transports to pass `protocolSchemas: runtimeProtocolSchemas` through to the channel.
11. **Delete v5 surface.** Remove every file in _Files to Delete_. Remove the `runner` field and `connect({ port })` overload from `createRuntimeClient`.
12. **Remove `Port.capabilities`.** Final mechanical sweep: delete `PortCapabilities`, drop the field from `wrapMessagePort`, drop the `port.capabilities` reads in `runtime-worker-dispatcher.ts` and any remaining adapter sites.
13. **Mark prior research docs as superseded.** Single line in each frontmatter.

Each step lands a small commit; the PR is reviewable serially. The v6 cutover is breaking but bounded.

These are explicit assumptions the blueprint makes. Each one is testable; if any breaks, the blueprint needs revision.

| #   | Assumption                                                                                                                                                                                    | How to falsify                                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A1  | Tau will not need a `Browser ↔ Web Worker (main) ↔ Web Worker (kernel)` topology in the next 12 months.                                                                                       | If the main worker becomes CPU-bound, revisit. Today the main thread is React + dockview, not CAD.                                                                |
| A2  | One `RuntimeTransport` per `RuntimeClient` is sufficient. No client needs two simultaneous wires (e.g. one local + one remote).                                                               | If we ship a "remote rendering" tier where the client uses a local web-worker for fast geometry and a remote node-worker for heavy CAD, this assumption breaks.   |
| A3  | Electron renderer ↔ utility-process `MessagePortMain`s relayed via main support `SharedArrayBuffer` and full transferables for the v6 PoC.                                                    | Verified empirically in v5 spike; needs a regression test in the e2e suite.                                                                                       |
| A4  | `crossOriginIsolated === true` is required for SAB on browser wires. The web-worker transport reads this at construction.                                                                     | Web spec requirement. The transport degrades gracefully (no SAB pools) when not crossOriginIsolated.                                                              |
| A5  | The runtime protocol surface (the call/notify list above) is closed for v6. New protocol entries require a transport-version bump.                                                            | If a kernel needs a new top-level call (e.g. `getCapabilities` as a separate call), revisit the protocol map.                                                     |
| A6  | The FS bridge protocol (`FsProtocol`) stays separate from `RuntimeProtocol`. They never share a channel.                                                                                      | Could break if we want FS reads to interleave with kernel calls under a single flow-control window.                                                               |
| A7  | The `signal-slot` SAB Atomics path is correct for cooperative cancellation across all SAB-capable wires (browser worker, node worker, electron utility).                                      | Needs a conformance test that toggles the slot and verifies the host returns from a long render within N ms on every SAB-capable transport.                       |
| A8  | `defineKernel`, `defineBundler`, `defineTranscoder`, `defineMiddleware` shapes do not need changes for v6.                                                                                    | Plugin shapes were stabilised pre-v5 and are orthogonal to transport. Verified by reading current code.                                                           |
| A9  | The consumer never wants to construct a `Channel<RuntimeProtocol>` directly. Only transport authors do.                                                                                       | If a use-case appears (e.g. a custom test harness that wants to inject a fake channel), expose a private test factory; do not weaken the public API.              |
| A10 | The `RuntimeFileSystem` shape is rich enough that the consumer never needs the underlying handle. All access goes through the FS object's typed methods.                                      | Verified by reading current `apps/ui` consumer sites; none reach into the handle.                                                                                 |
| A11 | The Electron Topology C performance numbers from the v5 spike are representative. Renderer ↔ utility-process latency for runtime calls < 1 ms; geometry frames pool-delivered with zero-copy. | Will be re-verified in the v6 e2e benchmark.                                                                                                                      |
| A12 | The bundled transports cover ≥ 99% of consumer needs. Bespoke transports (WebSocket, WebRTC, Cloudflare Workers) are author-extensions, not blockers.                                         | Open question — surfaced if a consumer asks for a remote transport.                                                                                               |
| A13 | Phantom-carrier generics on `RuntimeTransportPlugin` propagate cleanly through `createRuntimeClient`'s tuple inference, exactly like `KernelPlugin`/`TranscoderPlugin` do today.              | Conformance tests C11 + C12 lock this in. If TypeScript regresses partial-inference behaviour, revisit.                                                           |
| A14 | Zod 4 (the version Tau already ships) handles every wire payload shape — including `z.instanceof(SharedArrayBuffer)` and `z.instanceof(MessagePort)` for transferable slots.                  | Author the schemas; if any payload requires a custom validator outside Zod's vocabulary, revisit.                                                                 |
| A15 | Per-frame Zod validation cost is negligible compared to kernel work (≥ 100 ms). The wire-validation overhead never appears in render-latency budgets.                                         | Benchmark on the heaviest wire (`electronUtilityTransport` Topology C) with the largest realistic geometry payload. If validation is > 1% of frame cost, revisit. |
| A16 | The runtime protocol's "calls" and "notifies" maps are stable enough that a Zod schema per entry is maintainable. Adding a new entry is a deliberate API change, not a routine event.         | Track schema-edit frequency over six months. If schemas churn weekly, revisit (might want a code generator).                                                      |

## Open Questions / Deferred

These are explicitly out-of-scope for v6 and will be revisited if and when a real requirement appears.

| #   | Deferred decision                                                 | Trigger to revisit                                                                        |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D1  | Built-in channel multiplexer                                      | A transport needs to share one wire across ≥ 3 concerns (FS + runtime + telemetry + ...). |
| D2  | Multi-runtime client (one client, two transports for two kernels) | A consumer wants Python + JS kernels in the same client.                                  |
| D3  | Promote `electronUtilityTransport` into `@taucad/runtime`         | The transport ships unchanged for one release cycle and the API surface is stable.        |
| D4  | Transport-level lifecycle respawn (auto-restart crashed worker)   | Production reliability data shows worker crashes are common.                              |
| D5  | Native-addon support inside `utilityProcess`                      | A native CAD addon needs to ship (today's WASM kernels are sufficient).                   |
| D6  | Remote / WebSocket transport                                      | A "render in the cloud" feature is prioritised.                                           |
| D7  | Consumer-owned `Channel<RuntimeProtocol>` (test injection)        | A test harness needs deterministic message ordering across multiple workers.              |

## Appendix B — Conformance Tests

To prevent the v6 architecture from drifting back into v5 patterns, the cutover ships a small set of conformance tests that fail loudly if the rules are violated.

| C9  | `runtime-filesystem-opaque.test-d.ts`                  | `RuntimeFileSystem` has no public `kind` / `port` / `handle` accessor; reaching into it produces a type error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| C10 | `legacy-runner-deletion.test.ts`                       | Importing from `@taucad/runtime/runner` produces a module-not-found error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| C11 | `define-transport.test-d.ts`                           | Phantom-carrier preservation across the transport plugin layer. Each phantom (`Protocol`, `BindingsExtra`, `Id`, `ClientOptions`, `HostOptions`) survives the `defineRuntimeTransport` → `RuntimeTransportPlugin` → `createRuntimeClient` → `RuntimeClient.transport` chain. Mirrors `define-plugin.test-d.ts` for kernels/transcoders. |
| C12 | `transport-generic-inference.test-d.ts`                | Consumer call sites infer literal transport ids and per-options shapes without explicit type parameters. `client.transport.id` narrows to the literal `'web-worker'` / `'in-process'` / etc.; `webWorkerTransport({ ... })` rejects unknown option keys at compile time.                                                                |
| C13 | `host-initialize-bindings-generic.test-d.ts`           | `HostInitializeBindings<TExtra>` correctly intersects the canonical core with `TExtra`. A transport declaring `BindingsExtra = { remoteAuth: AuthContext }` gets `bindings.remoteAuth` typed as `AuthContext` while still seeing the core fields.                                                                                       |
| C14 | `wire-protocol-validation.test.ts`                     | Channel server with `protocolSchemas` rejects malformed call args / notify args at the wire boundary, throwing `WireValidationError` with the Zod issue list. Channel without `protocolSchemas` skips validation.                                                                                                                       |
| C15 | `runtime-protocol-schema-coverage.test.ts`             | Every entry in `RuntimeProtocol['calls']` and `RuntimeProtocol['notifies']` has a matching Zod schema in `runtimeProtocolSchemas`. New protocol entries fail this test until they ship a validator.                                                                                                                                     |
| C16 | `runtime-protocol-types-derive-from-schemas.test-d.ts` | `RuntimeInitializeArgs`, `RuntimeExportArgs`, etc. are structurally `z.input<typeof xSchema>`. Hand-rewriting any of these type aliases to drift from the schema fails the test.                                                                                                                                                        |
| C17 | `kernel-plugin-api-correctness.test-d.ts`              | `KernelPlugin` does **not** carry a `worker` field. `createKernelPlugin` accepts only the documented config keys. (Sentinel for the v6-doc kernel-API correction — prevents future docs from reintroducing the misconception.)                                                                                                          |

These tests live alongside the production code in their respective packages; they execute in CI on every PR.
