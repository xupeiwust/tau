# Dynamic ES Module Loading in Web Workers: Performance Research

## Executive Summary

The **root cause** is a misconfigured `assetsInlineLimit` in `vite.config.ts` that
force-inlines `.wasm` files as base64 data URLs into JavaScript chunks. This inflates
the `replicad.kernel` chunk to **57 MB** (containing two ~20 MB WASM binaries as
base64 strings), which exceeds Chrome's per-entry bytecode cache limit (~20-30 MB).
V8 recompiles 57 MB of JavaScript on **every page load** (232ms), because the
produced 59.6 MB bytecode cache is silently rejected by Chrome's `GeneratedCodeCache`
disk backend.

**Fix**: Change `assetsInlineLimit` to stop force-inlining WASM binaries. This reduces
the chunk from 57 MB to ~308 KB, enables bytecode caching, and drops compile time from
232ms to near-instant. Verified: after fix, `kernel.select` disappears from telemetry
entirely and render time drops to 229ms (dominated by actual CAD computation).

## 1. Problem Statement

After introducing ES module dependency injection for kernel plugins (dynamically
loading kernel modules via `import(/* @vite-ignore */ moduleUrl)` instead of
statically bundling them into a single worker), the kernel startup time in production
builds regressed from fast (~200ms total) to consistently slow (~1.3s), with
`kernel.select` alone taking ~1s on every page reload.

### Observed Telemetry (5 consecutive reloads, same project assets)

| Span                            | Time           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `kernel.bootstrap`              | 58-83ms        |
| `kernel.bundler-init`           | 79-120ms       |
| `kernel.select`                 | 936ms-1.15s    |
| ├ `kernel.load-module`          | 492-579ms      |
| ├ `replicad.resolve-bindings`   | 90-194ms       |
| ├ `wasm.compile`                | 253-314ms      |
| └ `wasm.emscripten-init`        | 38-49ms        |
| **Total `kernel.resolve-deps`** | **1.26-1.56s** |

The startup penalty is **consistent across reloads** — no improvement from browser
caching despite identical asset URLs.

---

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 The `assetsInlineLimit` Bug

In `apps/ui/vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
build: {
  assetsInlineLimit(file) {
    // Don't inline SVGs
    return !file.endsWith('.svg');
  },
}
```

Vite's `assetsInlineLimit` callback semantics:

- Return `true` → **force inline** (regardless of size)
- Return `false` → **never inline**
- Return `undefined` → use default size threshold (4096 bytes)

The current code returns `true` for all non-SVG files, including `.wasm` files.
This causes Vite to base64-encode WASM binaries (19-22 MB each) and embed them as
`data:application/wasm;base64,...` strings inside JavaScript chunks.

### 2.2 Chunk Size Impact

Build output analysis (`apps/ui/build/client/assets/`):

| Chunk                           | Total Size | Inline Data                         | Actual Code |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `replicad.kernel-CHV4DDRI.js`   | **57 MB**  | 56.7 MB (2 WASM + sourcemap + font) | ~300 KB     |
| `replicad_with_exceptions-*.js` | 30 MB      | 29.6 MB (1 WASM)                    | ~100 KB     |
| `replicad_single-*.js`          | 25 MB      | 25.3 MB (1 WASM)                    | ~100 KB     |
| `esbuild.bundler-*.js`          | 17 MB      | 17.2 MB (1 WASM)                    | ~100 KB     |
| `kcl_wasm_lib-*.js`             | 19 MB      | — (code-heavy)                      | ~19 MB      |

The `replicad.kernel` chunk contains **both** OpenCASCADE WASM variants inlined as
base64 data URLs:

- `data:application/wasm;base64,...` — 29.63 MB (exceptions variant)
- `data:application/wasm;base64,...` — 25.29 MB (single variant)

No `.wasm` files were emitted in the build output. All WASM was inlined.

### 2.2.1 How Vite Detects WASM References

The Emscripten-generated bindings files (e.g. `replicad_single.js`) use Vite's
`new URL()` asset reference pattern to locate their companion WASM binary:

```javascript
return new URL('replicad_single.wasm', import.meta.url).href;
```

When Vite encounters `new URL(staticPath, import.meta.url)`, it:

1. Resolves the referenced file relative to the source module
2. Checks `assetsInlineLimit` to decide whether to inline or emit
3. If inlining: replaces the expression with a `data:` URL containing the
   base64-encoded file contents
4. If emitting: copies the file to `/assets/` with a content hash and
   replaces the expression with the hashed URL

With `assetsInlineLimit` returning `true` for `.wasm` files, step 3 was
triggered for every WASM binary, embedding 19-22 MB of base64 data into
each JavaScript chunk that referenced a WASM file.

### 2.3 V8 Bytecode Cache Failure

Chrome traces (`chrome://tracing`) reveal the caching failure chain:

**Step 1: Compile (every load)**

```
v8.compileModule  replicad.kernel-CHV4DDRI.js
  dur=232ms  cacheKind=ABSENT  consumedCacheSize=ABSENT
```

No cache metadata fields are present — the cache was never consulted.

**Step 2: Cache Production (fires once)**

```
v8.produceModuleCache  replicad.kernel-CHV4DDRI.js
  producedCacheSize=59,663,120 bytes (59.6 MB)
  dur=42.8ms
```

V8 serializes 59.6 MB of bytecode and hands it to Chrome's storage layer.

**Step 3: Cache Storage (silently fails)**
The 59.6 MB entry exceeds Chrome's `GeneratedCodeCache` per-entry limit. The write
fails silently. No cache is stored.

**Step 4: Next reload (cache miss)**

```
v8.compileModule  replicad.kernel-CHV4DDRI.js
  dur=228ms  cacheKind=ABSENT  consumedCacheSize=ABSENT
```

Still no cache. The 232ms compile repeats on every reload.

### 2.4 Comparison with Working Modules

Modules with bytecode caches ≤20 MB work correctly:

| Module                | JS Size   | Cache Size  | Cached?                  | Compile Time |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| `esbuild.bundler`     | 17 MB     | 18.0 MB     | **YES** (always)         | 5ms          |
| `kcl_wasm_lib`        | 19 MB     | 19.8 MB     | **YES** (after 1st load) | 0.7ms        |
| `kcl_wasm_lib_bg`     | 19 MB     | 19.8 MB     | **YES** (always)         | <0.1ms       |
| `schemas`             | 107 KB    | 122 KB      | **YES** (always)         | 0.2ms        |
| **`replicad.kernel`** | **57 MB** | **59.6 MB** | **NEVER**                | **232ms**    |

The threshold appears to be ~20-30 MB of bytecode. Everything below caches fine.
The 59.6 MB `replicad.kernel` cache is 3x over the limit.

### 2.5 Worker Module Caching Behavior

Chrome trace analysis across 3 page reloads reveals two classes of worker modules:

**Cached modules** (have `cacheKind: normal` from load 1):
These had their bytecode cache established in prior sessions and are consumed
by workers. All have cache sizes ≤ 18 MB.

**Never-cached modules** (no `cacheKind` field on any load):

1. **Worker entry points** — Chrome excludes the top-level module script of
   `new Worker(url, {type: 'module'})` from code caching. This is the
   `kNoCacheBecauseModule` reason in V8's `ScriptCompiler::NoCacheReason` enum.
2. **Small utility modules** — likely excluded by `kNoCacheBecauseScriptTooSmall`.
3. **`replicad.kernel`** — excluded because its cache exceeds the storage limit.

---

## 3. V8 Code Caching Internals

### 3.1 Cache Lifecycle (cold → warm → hot)

V8's code cache follows a three-phase lifecycle:

1. **Cold**: Module is compiled from source. No cache available.
2. **Warm**: After execution, V8 serializes the compiled bytecode via
   `ScriptCompiler::CreateCodeCache()` (for modules:
   `CreateCodeCache(Local<UnboundModuleScript>)`). The embedder (Chrome/Blink)
   stores this as metadata in the `GeneratedCodeCache` disk backend.
3. **Hot**: On subsequent loads, Chrome provides the cached bytecode via
   `CachedData`. V8 deserializes instead of compiling (~10-50x faster).

### 3.2 NoCacheReason Enum (V8 `include/v8-script.h`)

```cpp
enum NoCacheReason {
  kNoCacheNoReason = 0,
  kNoCacheBecauseCachingDisabled,
  kNoCacheBecauseNoResource,
  kNoCacheBecauseInlineScript,
  kNoCacheBecauseModule,          // Worker top-level module scripts
  kNoCacheBecauseStreamingSource,
  kNoCacheBecauseScriptTooSmall,
  kNoCacheBecauseCacheTooCold,
  // ...
};
```

- `kNoCacheBecauseModule`: Used by Blink for worker top-level module scripts
  (the entry point passed to `new Worker(url, {type: 'module'})`). These are
  never cached. However, modules imported FROM the worker (static or dynamic)
  CAN be cached.
- `kNoCacheBecauseScriptTooSmall`: Modules under a threshold (~1 KB bytecode)
  are not worth caching.

### 3.3 Chrome GeneratedCodeCache

Chrome stores bytecode caches in a `SimpleBackend` disk cache at:
`~/.config/chromium/Default/Code Cache/js/` (Linux) or equivalent.

Key constraints:

- **Per-entry size limit**: Approximately 1/8 of total cache size. For a
  default 256 MB cache, max entry ≈ 32 MB. For smaller caches, the limit
  is proportionally lower.
- **Total cache size**: Configurable, typically 150-256 MB.
- **Write failures are silent**: When an entry exceeds the limit, the write
  is dropped without error. The trace shows `v8.produceModuleCache` firing
  successfully, but the storage layer doesn't persist the data.

### 3.4 Streaming Compilation

Worker module scripts have streaming disabled (`notStreamedReason: "already
disabled streaming"`). This means the browser must fully download the module
before parsing/compiling can begin. For a 57 MB chunk, this adds significant
download time before compilation even starts.

With WASM files emitted separately, `WebAssembly.compileStreaming()` handles
WASM compilation in parallel with the download — V8's Liftoff compiler can
begin before the full binary is available.

---

## 4. The Fix

### 4.1 Primary: Fix `assetsInlineLimit`

```typescript
// apps/ui/vite.config.ts
build: {
  assetsInlineLimit(file) {
    // Never inline SVGs (handled by sprite system)
    if (file.endsWith('.svg')) {
      return false;
    }
    // Use default threshold (4096 bytes) for everything else
    return undefined;
  },
}
```

### 4.2 Verified Results

Build output comparison (before → after):

| Chunk                      | Before | After      | Reduction |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------- |
| `replicad.kernel`          | 57 MB  | **308 KB** | 185x      |
| `esbuild.bundler`          | 17 MB  | **81 KB**  | 212x      |
| `replicad_with_exceptions` | 30 MB  | **67 KB**  | 447x      |
| `replicad_single`          | 25 MB  | **67 KB**  | 373x      |

WASM files now emitted as separate assets:

- `replicad_single-*.wasm` — 19.9 MB
- `replicad_with_exceptions-*.wasm` — 23.3 MB
- `esbuild-*.wasm` — 13.5 MB
- `kcl_wasm_lib_bg-*.wasm` — 14.9 MB
- `manifold-*.wasm` — 476 KB

### 4.3 Verified Telemetry (after fix)

With the fix applied, `kernel.select` no longer appears in telemetry
(module loading is near-instant). The render is dominated by actual CAD
computation:

| Span                 | Before (broken) | After (fixed)                   |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `kernel.select`      | 936ms-1.15s     | **not visible** (< 1ms)         |
| `kernel.load-module` | 492-579ms       | **not visible**                 |
| `replicad.run-main`  | ~226ms          | ~226ms (unchanged, actual work) |
| **Total render**     | **1.26-1.56s**  | **229ms**                       |

### 4.4 WASM Loading Path (after fix)

1. `replicad.kernel` (308 KB) → compiled with cached bytecode (< 1ms)
2. `resolveWasm()` → dynamic imports bindings chunk (67 KB, cached)
3. Bindings chunk → `new URL("*.wasm", import.meta.url)` → separate `.wasm` file
4. `compileWasmStreaming(wasmUrl)` → V8 streams and caches WASM compilation

---

## 5. How the Dep Injection Pattern Interacts

The ES module dependency injection pattern (`import(/* @vite-ignore */ moduleUrl)`)
is NOT the root cause. The dynamic import itself works correctly:

- `esbuild.bundler` is loaded via the same `import(/* @vite-ignore */ url)` pattern
  and is cached successfully (when its bytecode ≤ 20 MB).
- `kcl_wasm_lib` is loaded via static import on the main thread and is cached.

The dep injection pattern does introduce a **sequential waterfall**:

```
worker entry → framework init → dynamic import(kernel) → dynamic import(bindings) → WASM load
```

Each step requires: network fetch → parse → compile → execute. With proper
bytecode caching, the compile step is near-instant (2-5ms), making the
waterfall acceptable. Without caching (due to the WASM inlining bug), the
compile step dominates.

### Waterfall After Fix (verified)

| Step                        | Before (no cache) | After (cached)                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `kernel.load-module`        | 513ms             | < 1ms (cached bytecode)         |
| `replicad.resolve-bindings` | 92ms              | < 1ms                           |
| `wasm.compile`              | 255ms             | < 1ms (cached after first load) |
| `wasm.emscripten-init`      | 39ms              | ~39ms                           |
| **Total overhead**          | **~900ms**        | **~40ms**                       |

The WASM compile benefits from V8's `NativeModuleCache` (verified in traces:
`CacheHit` for 14.9 MB OC binary). After the first render within a session,
WASM instantiation drops to ~1ms.

---

## 6. Trace Evidence Summary

### Data from `trace_multi-reload-tracing.json.gz` (5 page reloads)

**`replicad.kernel` cache lifecycle across reloads:**

```
Load 1: v8.compileModule     dur=232ms  cacheKind=ABSENT   ← cold compile
Load 2: v8.compileModule     dur=228ms  cacheKind=ABSENT   ← still cold
         v8.produceModuleCache  produced=59,663,120 bytes  ← cache produced...
Load 3: v8.compileModule     dur=221ms  cacheKind=ABSENT   ← ...but never stored!
```

**`esbuild.bundler` cache lifecycle (comparison):**

```
Load 1: v8.compileModule  dur=5ms  cacheKind=normal  consumed=18,052,912  ← hot
Load 2: v8.compileModule  dur=5ms  cacheKind=normal  consumed=18,052,912  ← hot
Load 3: v8.compileModule  dur=5ms  cacheKind=normal  consumed=18,052,912  ← hot
```

**Key contrast:**

- `esbuild.bundler` (17 MB JS → 18 MB cache): `cacheKind=normal` ✓
- `replicad.kernel` (57 MB JS → 59.6 MB cache): `cacheKind=ABSENT` ✗

The `cacheKind` field is **completely absent** from `replicad.kernel` compile
events — the bytecode cache infrastructure is never consulted because no cached
metadata exists for this resource (the prior write was silently dropped).

---

## 7. Additional Notes

### 7.1 Worker Entry Point Caching

Worker top-level module scripts (the URL passed to `new Worker(url, {type: 'module'})`)
are never bytecode-cached in Chrome. This is by design (`kNoCacheBecauseModule`).
In our architecture, the worker entry (`kernel-runtime-worker.ts`) is only 26 KB,
so this is not a significant concern.

### 7.2 Base64 Overhead

Base64 encoding adds 33% size overhead. A 19 MB WASM binary becomes a 25 MB base64
string literal. V8 must parse this 25 MB string on every compile — pure waste that
compounds the caching problem.

### 7.3 WASM Duplication

The `replicad.kernel` chunk contains BOTH WASM variants (single + exceptions) inlined,
even though only ONE is loaded at runtime (via a conditional dynamic import). After
the fix, this duplication is eliminated because the WASM files are separate assets
loaded on-demand.

### 7.4 esbuild-wasm

The `esbuild.bundler` chunk (17 MB) also had an inline WASM (17.2 MB from `esbuild-wasm`).
After fixing `assetsInlineLimit`, this chunk shrank to 81 KB. While `esbuild.bundler`
was already within Chrome's cache limit and working, the fix eliminates 17 MB of
unnecessary base64 parsing, reduces bandwidth, and improves cold load performance.

### 7.5 `new URL()` Pattern as the Inlining Trigger

The specific mechanism that caused Vite to inline WASM was the `new URL()` asset
reference pattern used by Emscripten-generated bindings. For example,
`replicad_single.js` contains:

```javascript
return new URL('replicad_single.wasm', import.meta.url).href;
```

This pattern is Vite's standard way to reference static assets from JavaScript.
Vite intercepts these expressions at build time and applies `assetsInlineLimit` to
decide whether to inline or emit the referenced file. Since the buggy callback
returned `true` for `.wasm`, all WASM references through this pattern were inlined.

Other WASM-using libraries (`esbuild-wasm`, `manifold-3d`, `kcl-wasm-lib`, etc.)
use the same pattern and were similarly affected. The fix benefits all of them.

---

## 8. Residual WASM Init Cost (post-fix)

After fixing the `assetsInlineLimit` bug, a residual ~131ms WASM init cost
remains on each kernel startup (e.g., when switching between projects that
use the same kernel). Chrome tracing confirms all caches are working, but
the streaming pipeline has inherent overhead.

### 8.1 Trace-Verified Timeline (replicad_with_exceptions, 22.2 MB)

```
+  0.0ms  wasm.StartStreamingCompilation
+ 3-55ms  wasm.OnBytesReceived  (160 chunks, 22.2 MB from HTTP cache)
+ 58.5ms  wasm.FinishStreaming                dur=19.9ms
+ 70.1ms    └─ wasm.Deserialize               dur= 8.3ms  (disk cache → memory)
+ 72.0ms        └─ wasm.GetNativeModuleFromCache  dur=0.1ms  (process cache HIT)
+ 78.2ms  wasm.CompilationAfterDeserialization dur= 0.1ms  (schedule lazy funcs)
+ 80.2ms  wasm.SyncInstantiate                dur= 2.4ms
= 82.6ms  TOTAL (matches our 79ms wasm.compile span)
```

### 8.2 Cache Status: All Working

V8's NativeModuleCache (process-level, shared across isolates) shows cache
hits for all WASM modules:

| Module                     | Wire Bytes | Cache Lookup | Status |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------ |
| `replicad_with_exceptions` | 22.2 MB    | 0.13ms       | HIT    |
| `esbuild`                  | 12.9 MB    | 0.02ms       | HIT    |
| `kcl_wasm_lib`             | 14.2 MB    | 1.24ms       | HIT    |

### 8.3 Where the 131ms Goes

Despite cache hits, two costs are inherent per-worker-creation:

**`wasm.compile` (79ms)** — Streaming pipeline overhead:

- **55ms**: Fetching 22 MB through Chrome's Mojo data pipe, even from the
  HTTP disk cache. The data physically flows through the IPC pipeline;
  `compileStreaming(fetch(url))` cannot short-circuit before the fetch
  completes because the streaming compiler must validate the bytes match
  the cached module.
- **20ms**: `FinishStreaming` — includes deserializing cached native code
  from disk (8ms) and verifying against the NativeModuleCache (0.1ms).
- **2.4ms**: `SyncInstantiate` — memory allocation, table setup.

**`wasm.emscripten-init` (44ms, 37ms self-time)** — Emscripten runtime
bootstrap:

- **4-5ms**: `wasm.instantiate` — allocating linear memory, linking imports.
- **~37ms**: Emscripten runtime initialization — C++ global constructors
  for OpenCASCADE, virtual filesystem setup, `GrowMemory` calls. This is
  inherent to the library and executes every time a new Emscripten instance
  is created.

### 8.4 Existing Worker Pooling

The application already implements worker pooling **within a project session**.
The architecture in `apps/ui/app/hooks/use-project.tsx` and
`apps/ui/app/machines/project.machine.ts` manages "compilation units" — each
a `cadMachine` actor that owns a `kernelMachine` actor, which owns the Web
Worker and `RuntimeClient`. Within a project:

- **File changes**: trigger `setFile` on the existing compilation unit — the
  worker stays alive and reprocesses with the warm WASM instance.
- **Parameter changes**: trigger `setParameters` — same worker, no init cost.
- **Same-file reload**: the compilation unit is reused if it already exists
  for the entry file (`compilationUnits.has(mainFile)` check in
  `initializeKernelIfNeeded`).

This means the ~56ms WASM init cost is paid **once per project session**, not
per render. During iterative development (the primary workflow), the worker
stays alive and `wasm.compile` + `wasm.emscripten-init` cost is zero.

### 8.5 When Worker Recreation Occurs

Workers are destroyed and recreated when **switching between projects**
(projects). The project machine's `loadProject` transition with a different
`projectId` triggers:

```
project.machine (loadProject, isProjectIdChanging)
  → stopStatefulActors: stop all compilation units (enqueue.stopChild)
  → respawnStatefulActors: compilationUnits = new Map()

cadMachine stopped → kernelMachine exit → destroyWorkers
  → kernelClient.terminate() → workerClient.terminate()
    → worker.terminate()  ← V8 isolate destroyed, WASM state lost
```

When the new project loads, `initializeKernelIfNeeded` spawns a fresh
`cadMachine` → `kernelMachine` → new Worker → full WASM init (~56ms with
warm caches).

### 8.6 Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Keep workers alive across project switches (future improvement)**

Instead of destroying compilation units when the `projectId` changes, the
project machine could detach and reattach them. When the new project uses the
same kernel type (e.g., Replicad), the existing worker stays alive and
only the file/parameters are updated. `KernelRuntimeWorker` already loads
kernels lazily and caches them; the missing piece is not destroying the
worker at the `project.machine` level.

This would eliminate the ~56ms WASM init cost on project switches. Given
that this cost is small relative to geometry computation (100-500ms+) and
only occurs once per project switch (not per render), this is a low-priority
future improvement. The primary workflow — iterating on files within a
single project — already benefits from the existing within-project pooling.

Expected: `wasm.compile` (24ms) + `wasm.emscripten-init` (30ms) → **0ms**.

**Strategy 2: Transfer pre-compiled `WebAssembly.Module` via `postMessage`
(future improvement — deferred)**

Google's [web.dev guide](https://web.dev/articles/webassembly-performance-patterns-for-web-apps)
recommends compiling WASM once on the main thread and transferring the
`WebAssembly.Module` to workers via `postMessage`. V8 internally shares
compiled code through the NativeModuleCache (`shared_ptr<NativeModule>`),
so no actual copy or recompilation occurs.

**Deferred justification**: With V8's caching layers working correctly
(NativeModuleCache + GeneratedCodeCache), `wasm.compile` is consistently
20-30ms in practice. At this level the cost is negligible compared to
geometry computation (typically 100-500ms+). The `postMessage` transfer
pattern requires a round-trip to the main thread: the worker must request
the module, the main thread must respond, and the worker must receive and
instantiate it. This round-trip latency (message queue contention,
structured clone overhead, event loop scheduling on both sides) would
consume a significant portion of the 20-30ms savings, making the net
benefit marginal. V8's `compileStreaming(fetch(url))` already deserializes
cached TurboFan code in ~8ms and performs NativeModuleCache lookup in <1ms
— the remaining time is HTTP cache fetch IPC which the `postMessage`
approach merely trades for a different IPC path.

**Strategy 3: Pre-warm WASM at app startup (moves cost off critical path)**

Start `WebAssembly.compileStreaming(fetch(wasmUrl))` on the main thread
immediately at app load, before any project is opened. This populates both
the HTTP cache and V8's NativeModuleCache. The per-worker cost remains but
the first render is faster since all caches are warm.

### 8.7 V8 Isolate Boundary Summary

Each Web Worker has its own V8 isolate. WASM caching operates at two levels:

| Cache Level                        | Scope            | Survives Worker Termination | Lookup Cost          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **NativeModuleCache**              | Renderer process | **Yes** (process-level)     | 0.02-1.3ms           |
| **GeneratedCodeCache** (disk)      | Profile / origin | **Yes** (disk)              | 3-11ms (deserialize) |
| **Compiled instance** (in-isolate) | Worker isolate   | **No**                      | 0ms (already loaded) |

When a worker is terminated and recreated, the in-isolate compiled instance
is lost. V8 must deserialize from disk cache (3-11ms) or NativeModuleCache
(0.02-1.3ms) and re-run the streaming pipeline. With warm caches, this
totals ~20-30ms for `wasm.compile` — fast enough that the primary
optimization lever is keeping the worker alive (either within-project pooling,
which we already do, or cross-project pooling as a future improvement).

## 9. Industry Research and External Validation

The optimization strategies identified in Section 8 are validated by published
research from V8 engineers, Google's web.dev team, and production WASM users.

### 9.1 Google's Official Recommendation (web.dev)

The [WebAssembly Performance Patterns](https://web.dev/articles/webassembly-performance-patterns-for-web-apps)
guide (Thomas Steiner, reviewed by V8/Chrome engineers Andreas Haas, Jakob
Kummerow, Deepti Gandluri) presents an escalating series of worker+WASM
patterns:

| Pattern     | Approach                                                                  | Our Status      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Bad         | Worker compiles on-demand, racy messages                                  | N/A             |
| Better      | Worker compiles on startup, stores promise                                | **Current**     |
| **Good**    | Main thread compiles once, transfers `Module` to worker via `postMessage` | **Recommended** |
| **Perfect** | Same as Good, worker inlined as `blob:` URL                               | Optional        |

The "Good" pattern directly maps to our Strategy 2. Key quote:

> "The Wasm module can be loaded and compiled just once in the main thread
> (or even another Web Worker purely concerned with loading and compiling),
> and then be transferred to the Web Worker responsible for the CPU-intensive
> task."

The guide also explicitly discusses the keep-alive vs. ad-hoc worker trade-off
(our Strategy 1) and recommends measuring with the User Timing API.

### 9.2 V8's NativeModuleCache: Process-Global Sharing

V8's `WasmEngine` maintains a process-global `NativeModuleCache` that maps
wire bytes to compiled `NativeModule` objects via `shared_ptr`. This is
confirmed in V8 source (`src/wasm/wasm-engine.cc`):

- `CompiledWasmModule` wraps a `shared_ptr<NativeModule>` that can be
  "potentially shared by different WasmModuleObjects"
  ([V8 API reference](https://v8.github.io/api/head/classv8_1_1CompiledWasmModule.html))
- When `WebAssembly.Module` is sent via `postMessage`, V8 performs structured
  clone serialization/deserialization (`src/wasm/wasm-serialization.cc`). The
  receiving isolate looks up the NativeModuleCache by wire bytes hash and
  gets a reference to the **same compiled code** — zero-copy, no recompilation.
- This explains our trace findings: NativeModuleCache hits at 0.02-1.3ms
  even after worker termination. The bottleneck is not recompilation — it is
  the `compileStreaming(fetch())` streaming pipeline overhead (55ms Mojo IPC
  - 20ms finalization) that runs before the cache is consulted.

**Key implication**: transferring a `WebAssembly.Module` via `postMessage`
bypasses the entire streaming pipeline. The receiving worker calls
`WebAssembly.instantiate(module, imports)` directly — no fetch, no streaming
decoder, no Mojo data pipe. This is why Strategy 2 saves ~79ms.

### 9.3 PSPDFKit's Production Experience (8 MB+ WASM)

[PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/optimize-webassembly-startup-performance/)
— one of the earliest large-scale WASM production deployments — documents
four key optimizations for their 8 MB+ `pspdfkit.wasm`:

1. **HTTP Cache-Control headers** — we have this via Vite content-hashed assets
2. **Streaming instantiation** — we use `compileStreaming`
3. **IndexedDB module caching** — **deprecated** (see Section 9.4)
4. **Object pooling of WASM backends** — they pool their entire WebAssembly
   worker backend, reusing initialized instances across document opens.
   This directly validates our Strategy 1 (keep workers alive).

PSPDFKit specifically notes that in SPA scenarios, "creating and destroying
`WebAssembly.Module` instances multiple times during the lifecycle of an
application" causes significant overhead, and their object pool of warmed-up
WASM worker backends is the primary mitigation. They report best-case
startup times of 200-300ms with these optimizations combined.

### 9.4 IndexedDB Caching: Deprecated

Explicit `WebAssembly.Module` caching via IndexedDB is deprecated and should
not be used:

- Firefox removed structured clone support for `WebAssembly.Module` in
  IndexedDB in v63 (October 2018)
- The WebAssembly Community Group decided browsers should handle caching
  implicitly rather than requiring explicit developer intervention
- MDN marks this approach as experimental/deprecated
- The recommended path is relying on browser-implicit caching via the
  streaming APIs and HTTP cache

**This rules out IndexedDB-based module caching as a viable strategy.**

### 9.5 Emscripten's `instantiateWasm` Hook

Emscripten [officially documents](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/module.html)
`Module.instantiateWasm()` as the supported mechanism for injecting
pre-compiled modules:

```javascript
Module['instantiateWasm'] = function (imports, successCallback) {
  var instance = new WebAssembly.Instance(precompiledModule, imports);
  successCallback(instance);
  return instance.exports;
};
```

Our `init-open-cascade.ts` already uses this hook. The only change needed for
Strategy 2 is accepting a pre-compiled `WebAssembly.Module` argument instead
of always calling `compileStreaming(fetch(url))`.

**Reuse constraint**: Emscripten discussions confirm that C++ global
constructors only execute once per instance. OpenCASCADE's global state
(memory allocator, shape factory tables, etc.) is initialized during these
constructors. This means:

- **A single Emscripten instance cannot be re-initialized** — you cannot call
  the factory function again on the same instance to reset state
- **The compiled `WebAssembly.Module` can be reused** across instances — each
  call to `WebAssembly.instantiate(module, imports)` creates fresh memory
  and re-runs constructors
- **Keeping the worker alive** (Strategy 1) preserves the existing instance;
  state cleanup must happen at the application level (e.g., deleting shapes)

### 9.6 V8 Compilation Pipeline Details

From [V8's documentation](https://v8.dev/docs/wasm-compilation-pipeline):

- **Liftoff** (baseline): One-pass compiler, compiles lazily on first function
  call. Tens of MB/s throughput. Code is not cached because Liftoff
  compilation is as fast as loading from cache.
- **TurboFan** (optimizing): Multi-pass compiler for hot functions. Code IS
  cached to disk via `GeneratedCodeCache` (for `compileStreaming` only).
- **Code caching only works with `compileStreaming`** — not `compile()`. This
  confirms our `compileWasmStreaming` approach is correct for cold starts.
  However, once a `WebAssembly.Module` has been compiled, transferring it
  via `postMessage` avoids the need for disk cache entirely.
- **Lazy compilation** (`chrome://flags/#enable-webassembly-lazy-compilation`):
  Functions are only compiled on first call, reducing upfront compile cost.
  May help with Emscripten init (~37ms) if many OpenCASCADE functions are
  compiled eagerly but not called during init.

### 9.7 WASM ESM Integration (Future)

The [esm-integration proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration)
(Phase 3) will eventually allow static WASM imports:

```javascript
import { run } from './module.wasm';
```

Mozilla's [February 2026 blog post](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2026/02/making-webassembly-a-first-class-language-on-the-web/)
confirms active implementation in Firefox. This would let browsers handle
WASM compilation, caching, and loading natively through the module graph,
potentially eliminating the streaming pipeline overhead entirely. However,
this is not yet available in browsers and does not help short-term.

### 9.8 Strategies Ruled Out by Research

| Strategy                                            | Reason                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IndexedDB `WebAssembly.Module` cache                | Deprecated, being removed from browsers                                     |
| Sharing `WebAssembly.Instance` via `postMessage`    | Instances are not structured-cloneable                                      |
| `SharedArrayBuffer` for WASM memory                 | Does not help with compilation overhead; adds COOP/COEP header requirements |
| `WebAssembly.compile(arrayBuffer)` for code caching | V8 only code-caches from `compileStreaming`, not `compile()`                |

### 9.9 Validated Strategy Ranking

| Strategy                                      | Savings                           | Industry Validation                                 | Status                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Within-project worker pooling**             | Full WASM init avoided per render | PSPDFKit object pooling, web.dev "permanent worker" | **Already implemented**      |
| **Cross-project worker pooling** (Strategy 1) | ~56ms per project switch          | PSPDFKit object pooling                             | Future (low priority)        |
| **Pre-warm at app startup** (Strategy 3)      | First-load latency                | web.dev `<link rel="preload">`                      | Future (low-cost complement) |
| **Transfer pre-compiled Module** (Strategy 2) | ~20-30ms theoretical              | web.dev "Good/Perfect" pattern                      | **Deferred** (see below)     |

**Current state**: The application already keeps workers alive within a
project session. File changes, parameter changes, and re-renders all reuse
the same worker and WASM instance — the ~56ms init cost is paid once per
project session, not per render. This is the most important optimization
and it is already in place.

**Why Strategy 1 (cross-project) is low priority**: The ~56ms cost only
occurs when the user navigates to a different project (project ID change).
This is an infrequent navigation event, not part of the iterative
edit→render loop. The cost is also small relative to the project loading,
file system initialization, and geometry computation that follow.

**Why Strategy 2 is deferred**: With V8's NativeModuleCache and
GeneratedCodeCache both working correctly after the `assetsInlineLimit`
fix, `wasm.compile` consistently measures 20-30ms on warm caches. This
is negligible compared to typical geometry computation (100-500ms+).
The `postMessage` module transfer approach would replace
`compileStreaming(fetch())` with a main-thread round-trip (worker →
request module → main thread responds → worker receives → instantiate).
This round-trip involves message queue scheduling on both sides,
structured clone serialization, and event loop contention — overhead
that would consume a significant fraction of the 20-30ms savings. The
implementation complexity (coordinator lifecycle, message protocol,
error handling, fallback when main thread hasn't compiled yet) is not
justified by the marginal improvement. V8 already handles the heavy
lifting: TurboFan code is deserialized from disk cache in ~8ms and
NativeModuleCache lookup takes <1ms.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The ES module dependency injection pattern is **not** the performance problem.
The primary root cause was a Vite configuration bug that force-inlined large
WASM binaries into JavaScript chunks, exceeding V8's bytecode cache limits.
With the one-line fix to `assetsInlineLimit`, kernel startup drops from 1.3s
to ~229ms.

The application already implements the most impactful optimization: **worker
pooling within a project session**. The `ProjectProvider` → `projectMachine` →
`cadMachine` → `kernelMachine` hierarchy keeps the Web Worker alive across
file changes, parameter changes, and re-renders. The ~56ms WASM init cost
(24ms compile + 30ms emscripten init with warm caches) is paid once per
project session, not per render.

Two low-priority future improvements exist:

1. **Cross-project worker pooling** — keep workers alive when navigating between
   projects that use the same kernel type. Saves ~56ms per project switch,
   but this is an infrequent navigation event and the cost is small relative
   to project loading and geometry computation.
2. **Pre-compiled module transfer** via `postMessage` (web.dev's
   "Good/Perfect" pattern) — deferred because V8's caching layers already
   reduce `wasm.compile` to 20-30ms, and the main-thread round-trip overhead
   of the transfer would consume much of the savings.
